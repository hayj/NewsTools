        "text": "In a Saturday blogpost, Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez vowed to enact reforms to the party\u2019s presidential nominating process aimed at ensuring that \u201cthe new DNC will work to rebuild trust with the people we represent.\u201d\nPerez\u2019s column on Medium, entitled \u201cMaking 2020 Transparent,\u201d was a response to revelations by former interim DNC chairwoman Donna Brazile last week that in a signed agreement the committee had effectively surrendered its independence to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign in August 2015 \u2015 months before 2016 presidential primary voters went to the polls. Many supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) interpreted the news as confirmation that the party had treated him unfairly.\n\u201cI am more committed than ever before to restoring voters\u2019 faith in our democratic process because even the perception of impartiality or an unfair advantage undermines our ability to win,\u201d Perez said. \u201cThat is unacceptable.\u201d\n\u201cAfter listening to Democrats from every wing of our party, I\u2019ve developed a series of concrete reforms to put our principles into action and guarantee that under my watch, the new DNC will work to rebuild trust with the people we represent,\u201d he said.\nThe \u201cprinciples\u201d Perez plans to employ include deciding the presidential primary debate schedule well before voting in the contests begins and making transparent to the public any joint fundraising agreements the DNC makes.\nHe also promised to support the work of the Unity Reform Commission, a panel formed in July 2016 as a compromise with delegates who backed Sanders at the Democratic National Convention.\n\u201cWe will work with the Unity Reform Commission to implement their collective recommendations for meaningful change in our party,\u201d Perez said.\nGeorge Frey/Getty Images DNC Chairman Tom Perez has had to address a lingering divide in the Democratic Party between skeptical progressives and more establishment-minded party figures.\nThe commission is due to recommend reforms to the nominating process by January 2018. The 21-member panel is discussing plans to make the party\u2019s budget more transparent, diminish the role of so-called superdelegates in the nominating process, and make it easier for independents and new voters to participate in Democratic primaries and caucuses.\nNomiki Konst, one of eight Sanders appointees on the commission, expressed disappointment that Perez did not explicitly address DNC budget transparency and prohibiting the committee\u2019s voting members from having business with the organization or other conflicts of interest that could jade their ability to act impartially.",

        "text": "As Silicon Valley continues to become expensive to the point of unaffordability, it\u2019s become a common guessing game as to which metro area is poised to become the next \u201cit\u201d market for startups to flourish, find investors and win over consumers.\nNaturally, major locales like Seattle, New York, San Diego and Los Angeles are considered major tech hubs as well. Austin, Texas, has emerged in recent years as the go-to area for major tech companies looking for a more affordable alternative for employees, bringing startups and investors along with it.\nBut is Salt Lake City gearing up to take that title?\nCalled \"Silicon Slopes\" by many in the industry, Utah has seen steady growth in the analytic data industry in particular since the 1990s, and in more recent years the state has made significant progress in attracting startups and venture capitalists.\n\u201cThe real explosion in venture capital in Utah has really been in the last 10 years,\u201d says Mark Gorenberg, managing director of Zetta Venture Partners, who has invested in numerous Utah-based companies throughout his career, including data analytics company Omniture, before it was purchased by Adobe.\nIn commercial real estate company CBRE\u2019s annual report of key markets for tech momentum released in July, Salt Lake City showed more than 22 percent growth in tech talent in the last two years and is one of the most concentrated millennial markets in the U.S., with 21.8 percent of the urban population made up of millennials.\nFor workplace productivity firm Teem, a company that lists Gorenberg\u2019s Zetta Venture Partners and Google Ventures as investors, Salt Lake City has always been the ideal location to grow and attract the right talent. Plus, it\u2019s just a short plane ride to Silicon Valley, where many companies are benefiting from Teem\u2019s designs for a more productive, happier workplace.\n\u201cThere were several specific moments in time where we said, \u2018Hey, should we move to San Francisco? Should we move to the Bay Area?\u2019\u201d says Shaun Ritchie, CEO of Teem. But in the end, the pros for Salt Lake City outweighed the cons of being outside California. \u201cWe felt like we could build a world-class technology company not having to be down there [in Silicon Valley] all the time,\u201d Ritchie adds.\nAs will happen, the effects of business growth are having a direct effect on Salt Lake City's real estate industry. The average home price in Salt Lake City is currently $285,000, according to real estate information company Zillow, which is a 9.9 percent increase over the past year. Paul Benson, a real estate agent and CEO of Engel & Volkers Park City in Park City, Utah, says he has watched the luxury home market transform as more investments, startups and expansions occur throughout Salt Lake City and the surrounding areas.\n\u201cIt used to be in Utah we were looking for just a random [relocation] or we were looking for a ski-home buyer \u2013 somebody that was coming here primarily to ski,\u201d Benson says. \u201cThat has now switched to marketing a lot more in Northern California and places like Austin, Texas, for our buyers in the real estate world.\u201d\nIn March, technology executive network TechNet released an analysis of the parts of the country experiencing the most growth in startup job opportunities and tech business. The report ranks what it identifies as the 10 existing tech hubs, based on each area\u2019s startup economy. It\u2019s no surprise that the list begins with San Francisco; San Jose, California; Seattle; New York City; Boston and Austin, Texas.\nThe report then goes on to list the next 25 metro areas for their startup economies, considering them as emerging in the tech industry. Salt Lake City comes in at No. 14 overall, fourth among the emerging tech hubs.\nSalt Lake City\u2019s Secret Weapon to the South\nWhile Salt Lake City takes a prime spot on the emerging markets list, that doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate it as the runaway for new tech growth. However, Provo, Utah, a smaller neighbor to southwest of Salt Lake City, is already noted by the report as an existing tech hub \u2013 No. 7 on the list.\n\u201cIt moved to creating a larger ecosystem around the area, so it was not just Provo,\u201d Gorenberg says. \u201cNow companies were starting to move north. Sort of, again, in the same way I think you saw in Silicon Valley, where companies moved toward Palo Alto and then further north in the 1990s.\u201d\nBeyond Austin\nSilicon Slopes\u2019 proximity to Silicon Valley, extended role in the tech industry with Provo, a climate that appeals to ski lovers and those who prefer sunshine alike, an adventurous location and a welcoming culture draws more parallels not to Austin, but instead to the Mecca of tech itself.\n\u201cI think Utah could be the next Silicon Valley,\u201d Gorenberg says.\nIn fact, Gorenberg points out, the growth of the analytic data industry in Utah in many ways mimics the growth of software in Silicon Valley in the 1980s \u2013 beginning further south and expanding northward to encompass more of the San Francisco Bay Area.\nRoom to Grow\nBeyond business and job opportunities themselves, Salt Lake City serves as a draw for many entrepreneurs and recent grads looking to get into the startup game. Not only is it significantly less expensive than the likes of San Jose and San Francisco, but Salt Lake City is also situated with access to an international airport, ski resorts and major highways so that ground travel is rarely more than a half-hour heading anywhere.\nWhile Utah is widely recognized for its mountainous landscape and relatively small population at just over 3 million people, Salt Lake City is still a large city, and residents get all the benefits of living in a major metropolitan area.\nBecause many relocating from out of state find that urban setting appealing, Ritchie says he expects to see more companies placing their headquarters within city limits. \u201cThey\u2019re going to realize it\u2019s difficult to recruit from out of state when you live 20, 30 miles south in bedroom communities,\u201d Ritchie says.\nHousing Outlook\nAs far as the real estate market is concerned, there\u2019s certainly room to grow. Benson notes that Salt Lake City, like many other markets in the country, is seeing record low numbers of homes on the market and record high sale prices \u2013 but relative to San Francisco, San Jose and even Austin, the area is still more than affordable. Salt Lake city residents spend just 25.78 percent of their household income on housing expenses, based on information from the U.S. Census Bureau to calculate blended annual household income and the cost of living.\n\u201cOur prices started out so low that we haven\u2019t really priced ourselves out of anybody\u2019s market yet,\u201d Benson says.\nHe adds that the development of public transportation has made it so neighborhoods and suburbs are able to grow without being negatively impacted, and it\u2019s possible to live in Salt Lake City without a car and get around easily.\nCombined with the nearly ideal infrastructure to take on population growth, the fact that Utah\u2019s tech focus has largely been in information technology helps set the entire state up for success.\n\u201cThey\u2019re well-positioned for where the puck is going with information technology. \u2026 If anything, you\u2019re going to see more explosive growth there,\u201d Gorenberg says.",

Craig Ruttle/AP\nPolice say Ismaaiyl Brinsley ambushed the officers, fatally shooting them before killing himself inside a subway station.\nThe unidentified assailant was pursued into a nearby subway station, where he killed himself, police said.\nThe unidentified assailant was pursued into a nearby subway station, where he killed himself, police said.\nA gunman shot and killed two New York City police officers before taking his own life in a brazen ambush that played out on a quiet Brooklyn street corner Saturday afternoon, New York police said.\nOfficers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos were shot at point-blank range while sitting beside one another in a police car in the East Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn, police said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that this was an assassination,\u201d New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news conference Saturday night. \u201cThese officers were shot execution-style, a particularly despicable act which goes to the heart of our society and our democracy.\u201d\n\u201cIt is an attack on all of us,\u201d he added.\nRamos and Liu, who were shot in the head, were transported to Brooklyn\u2019s Woodhull Medical Center, where they were later pronounced dead, according to New York Police Commissioner William J. Bratton, who also spoke at the news conference Saturday evening.\nThe shooting has heightened tensions in a country and city already roiled by demonstrations against police brutality in the wake of recent killings of unarmed black men by white police officers in Missouri and New York.\nJust three hours before the shootings, the gunman \u2014 identified by police as 28-year-old Ismaaiyl Brinsley \u2014 declared his intention on his Instagram account to kill police officers as retribution for the recent police killings of Michael Brown and Eric Garner.\nBefore he made his way to Brooklyn on Saturday morning, police said, Brinsley shot his girlfriend about 5:45 a.m. in Owings Mills, Md., about 15 miles outside Baltimore. The shooting occurred at a gated apartment complex called Greenwich Place Town Center, adjacent to a parking lot for a movie theater at Owings Mills Mall.\nLate Saturday night, Baltimore County police confirmed that Brinsley was the gunman in the earlier shooting that wounded the 29-year-old Owings Mills woman. Police said the victim, whose name has not been released, was shot in the abdomen.\nPolice said Brinsley fled the scene of the shooting before they arrived. By 1:30 p.m., police said they became aware of Instagram posts by the suspect that included \u201cthreats against police officers.\u201d Authorities said they quickly traced the posts and the phone Brinsley was using to a location in Brooklyn.\nAbout 2:10 p.m., Baltimore County police called New York\u2019s 70th Precinct to discuss the threatening Instagram posts and informed officers that Brinsley\u2019s phone was \u201cpinging\u201d at a location in their precinct. At the same time, Baltimore County authorities said they faxed a \u201cwanted\u201d poster to the NYPD with information about Brinsley. Around 2:50 p.m., they sent a teletype with the same information in the flier to NYPD\u2019s \u201creal-time crime center.\u201d\nThey were too late. At about 2:45 p.m., police said, Brinsley approached the officers\u2019 marked NYPD patrol car outside the Tompkins Houses in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn and began firing into the front passenger-side window, striking both officers in the head.\nOfficers Wenjian Liu, left, and Rafael Ramos were killed Saturday in Brooklyn. The suspect ran to a subway station and killed himself, police said. (New York Police Department/AP)\nBrinsley\u2019s girlfriend was shot in the stomach and underwent surgery, according to a New York Daily News article. She was expected to recover.\n\u201cI\u2019m putting Wings on Pigs Today,\u201d Brinsley wrote on his Instagram account beneath a photo of a silver-colored semiautomatic pistol and a pair of blood-stained camouflage pants. \u201cThey TAKE 1 Of Ours . . . Lets Take 2 of Theirs.\u201d The Instagram photos use hashtags for Brown and Garner and appear to indicate that the shootings were an act of revenge.\nBrinsley stole his girlfriend\u2019s phone after the shooting before traveling to New York. At some point along the way, he posted a menacing update on Facebook.\n\u201cI Always Wanted To Be Known For Doing Something Right . . . But My Past Is Stalking Me and My Present Is Haunting Me,\u201d it read.\nBratton said investigators were looking into all of Brinsley\u2019s \u00adsocial-media accounts in an attempt to unravel the shooter\u2019s motivations.\n\u201cSome of the postings, which I understand are out there, would seem to indicate that he had a very strong bias against police officers,\u201d he said.\nBratton said investigators have no reason to believe Brinsley has any connection to terrorist groups.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing a connectivity to any organized entity at this time,\u201d he noted.\nA law enforcement official said the gunman started \u201cpumping bullets\u201d into the officer\u2019s car, the New York Post reported.\n\u201cThe perp came out of the houses, walked up behind the car and lit them up,\u201d a police official told the Daily News.\nAfter the shooting, Brinsley ran up the street and was pursued by other officers into a subway station, where he was found with a gunshot wound that appeared to be self-inflicted, police said. He was declared dead at a nearby hospital, police said.\nIn dozens of cities across the country in recent weeks, protesters have organized marches, staged die-ins, blocked rush-hour traffic and clashed with police using rallying cries tied to the killings of Brown and Garner \u2014 \u201cHands up, don\u2019t shoot,\u201d in Brown\u2019s case, and \u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d in reference to Garner\u2019s last words.\nMuch of those protests have been documented, if not fueled, by up-to-the-minute social media accounts, which have provided a virtual spark and rallying point for like-minded protesters aggressively seeking change.\nNew York City has served as the most prominent staging ground for many of the demonstrations, with protests happening almost nightly since a Ferguson grand jury declined to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson on Nov. 24 in Brown\u2019s shooting death.\nOn Saturday, Bratton said those demonstrations had taken their toll on New York City\u2019s police force.\nLast week, New York police arrested three men who are accused of assaulting two police lieutenants on the Brooklyn Bridge at the end of a march protesting the Eric Garner grand jury decision.\nAt the news conference Saturday night, Bratton said the day\u2019s shootings would only add to the growing feeling that New York police officers are under attack, but he said he expected them to endure.\n\u201cToday, two of New York\u2019s finest were shot and killed with no warning, no provocation,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were, quite simply, assassinated \u2014 targeted for their uniform and for the responsibility they embraced to keep the people of this city safe.\u201d\nIn a statement, President Obama said, \u201cI unconditionally condemn today\u2019s murder of two police officers in New York City. Two brave men won\u2019t be going home to their loved ones tonight, and for that, there is no justification. The officers who serve and protect our communities risk their own safety for ours every single day \u2014 and they deserve our respect and gratitude every single day,\u201d Obama said. \u201cTonight, I ask people to reject violence and words that harm, and turn to words that heal \u2014 prayer, patient dialogue, and sympathy for the friends and family of the fallen.\u201d\nAttorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. also condemned the shooting, calling it \u201can unspeakable act of barbarism. I was deeply saddened to hear of the loss of these two brave officers in the line duty.\n\u201cThis cowardly attack underscores the dangers that are routinely faced by those who protect and serve their fellow citizens,\u201d Holder said in a statement. \u201cAs a nation we must not forget this as we discuss the events of the recent past.\u201d\nThrough his National Action Network, the Rev. Al Sharpton released a statement several hours after the shooting condemning the use of violence as a means of affecting change.\n\u201cI have spoken to the Garner family and we are outraged by the early reports of the police killed in Brooklyn today,\u201d Sharpton said in the statement. \u201cAny use of the names of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, in connection with any violence or killing of police, is reprehensible and against the pursuit of justice in both cases.\u201d\nIn a statement, the family of Michael Brown condemned the \u201csenseless killing\u201d of the officers.\n\u201cWe reject any kind of violence directed toward members of law enforcement,\u201d read the statement, issued by family attorney Benjamin Crump. \u201cIt cannot be tolerated. We must work together to bring peace to our communities. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the officers\u2019 families during this incredibly difficult time.\u201d\nSome took aim at Holder, de Blasio and other government officials for what they view as anti-police statements in the wake of the Garner and Brown killings and judicial decisions.\n\u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t believe anyone connected to law enforcement is surprised this happened,\u201d said Gary McLhinney, a former Baltimore police union president and former chief of the Maryland Transportation Authority police, who is now a labor negotiator for police unions. \u201cPolitical rhetoric and lies have consequences. When our leaders make statements that encourage lawlessness and demean an entire profession, this is the result.\u201d\nAnd former New York governor George Pataki, responding to the shootings via Twitter, said that he was \u201csickened by these barbaric acts, which sadly are a predictable outcome of divisive anti-cop rhetoric\u201d of Holder and de Blasio.\nPresident Obama, who was on the first day of a two-week family vacation in Hawaii, was briefed on the Brooklyn police shooting by aides, the White House said.\nJ. Freedom du Lac, Peter Hermann, Ed O\u2019Keefe and David Nakamura contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Two astronauts will carry out the original lessons Christa McAuliffe had planned for her time in orbit in 1986.\nIn the summer of 1985, Christa McAuliffe was preparing to fly aboard the space shuttle Challenger to become the first private citizen in space. McAuliffe had been selected from more than 11,400 applicants for the government\u2019s Teacher in Space program. While in orbit, she planned to film science lessons that would be distributed to classrooms around the country after she returned. McAuliffe was never able to carry out those plans. The 37-year-old social-studies teacher and her six crewmates were killed during liftoff at Cape Canaveral in Florida in 1986. But now, a pair of NASA astronauts are hoping to finish what McAuliffe started. Joe Acaba and Ricky Arnold will carry out some of McAuliffe\u2019s original lesson plans on the International Space Station over the next several months. Acaba announced the news during a video call Friday with students at Framingham State University in Massachusetts, where McAuliffe graduated in 1970.\n\u201cWe look forward to helping to inspire the next generation of explorers and educations,\u201d Acaba said. The astronauts will film four lessons: on effervescence, liquids in zero gravity, a laboratory technique called chromatography, and Newton\u2019s laws, according to the Challenger Center, a nonprofit organization founded by the families of the astronauts who died in the shuttle accident. \u201cSeveral of the lessons will be completed as originally planned by Christa and a few will be reimagined based on materials available aboard the ISS,\u201d the organization said in a statement. The videos will be posted online in the spring. Acaba is on the International Space Station right now, and Arnold is scheduled to arrive in March. Both astronauts have teaching backgrounds. Acaba taught middle-school math and high-school science in Florida, and Arnold taught science in schools in Maryland, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, and Romania. The Teacher in Space program was created in 1984 under the Reagan administration. \u201cLook no further; I\u2019m the one,\u201d was the most repeated statement in the 15-page applications, according to Realizing Tomorrow: The Path to Private Spaceflight, a 2011 book by Chris Dubbs. Vice President George Bush introduced McAuliffe as the top pick at a ceremony at the White House in July 1985. McAuliffe taught history, law, and economics at Concord High School in New Hampshire. She put her life on hold for months as she trained alongside the NASA astronaut crew and her backup for the mission, Barbara Morgan, an elementary-school teacher from Idaho. After the Challenger disaster, Morgan worked in NASA\u2019s education division and eventually became an astronaut, flying on the space shuttle Endeavour in 2007. Morgan is one of the board members of the Challenger Center.",

So if annual tuition is, say, $50,000, and that cost is waived, the student would have to pay taxes on $50,000 of income. Jeremy Berg, the editor-in-chief of Science, is perplexed:\nIt is not clear what the objective is, as the new policy would disproportionately affect students without additional resources to support their educations and would likely decrease economic viability and competitiveness as talent is lost from the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) enterprise.\nWell, here\u2019s the thing: I\u2019m afraid STEM is just collateral damage in a war against economics, sociology, women\u2019s studies, education, history, and so forth. These are all areas that produce lots of lefties who write mean things about conservatives, and the objective of the tuition waiver is to make life hard for them. Unfortunately, the tax writers couldn\u2019t think of a way of making this provision apply only to \u201cfields that harbor lots of liberals,\u201d so STEM got hit too. Sorry about that.\nOn another note, I attended a math summer camp with Jeremy in 1975. We were not great friends or anything, but we all knew each other and this means he is now in the running for most famous person that I used to know when I was young. None of my friends from the 70s has won a Nobel Prize or become a show runner for HBO, so editor-in-chief of Science might well be the current top dog in my personal universe.",

She will be moving on to her new job in late January or early February \u2014 the exact date is not set yet.\nShe sat down with this reporter this week to talk about what has been accomplished at the college since she arrived more than eight years ago.\nThomas-Glover throughout her tenure always has been quick to acknowledge that operating the community college is a team effort, and her reflections upon preparing to leave are no different.\n\"I've had such a terrific team of individuals to work with,\" was how she began the interview.\nWhile the recent groundbreaking for a new academic building on campus is the most visible evidence of the college's recent accomplishments, Thomas-Glover recounted other, less visible achievements, which pave the way for a bright future for the institution, one of the Eastern Shore community's cornerstones.\nShe cited in particular a renewed focus on campus over the past several years on STEM \u2014 the academic world's acronym for science, technology, engineering and mathematics.\nThe focus makes sense, with NASA Wallops Flight Facility and its attendant aerospace businesses so close by and offering some of the best jobs available in the region to the Shore's youth.\nThomas-Glover during her tenure has seen a strengthening of ties between the community college and Wallops.\nShe herself has served on both the Wallops Leadership Council, an advisory body to Wallops Research Park, and as secretary of the Virginia Space Flight Authority board of directors, which governs the authority created by the Virginia General Assembly in 1995, with the legislated mission of promoting commercial space activity, economic development and aerospace research within the Commonwealth.\n\"I had the opportunity to meet with (NASA Wallops assistant director for management operations) Caroline Massey early on, and we were tossing around ideas \u2014 what could we do to strengthen that connection between the college and NASA and workforce development,\" Thomas-Glover recalled.\nDuring the conversation, Massey mentioned that students from across the United States come to Wallops Flight Facility for summer internships.\n\"And I thought, well, what about the fall and spring? We are here,\" Thomas-Glover said.\nShe approached the Eastern Shore Community College Foundation Board, chaired at the time by Pete Lalor, about providing a small stipend for student interns from the community college to help pay for their transportation costs to Wallops.\nThe board agreed to help support the initial project.\n\"We had some students placed in some internships there, and the response we got from NASA and the contractors was very positive,\" she said.\nSubsequently, Thomas-Glover and others at the college started looking for ways to make the fledgling Wallops internship program sustainable.\nSerendipitously, Thomas-Glover around then attended a session at an American Association of Community Colleges conference where the discussion was about a funding opportunity titled MentorLinks, funded by the association and the National Science Foundation and designed to help colleges develop or strengthen training programs in STEM fields through mentoring, professional development opportunities and technical assistance.\nThat led to the college applying for, and receiving, a $20,000 grant in 2011 \u2014 the first in the Virginia Community College System. It was a modest amount, but it got the program on firm footing.\n\"That became the foundation for us,\" Thomas-Glover said.\nThomas-Glover credited the grant-writing team of John Floyd, electronics faculty member; Eve Belote, associate vice president of advancement and grants; and Teresa Guy, Career Pathways coordinator, for drafting successful National Science Foundation grants that enabled the internship program and others that came later.\nThe internships were a key part of building relationships with community businesses and other partners, and have been a constant throughout later grant-funded programs.\n\"That set the stage for us to apply for a National Science Foundation grant that we got that was just under $200,000,\" the president said.\nThat was a three-year grant.\nThis summer, the college received news it would receive yet another National Science Foundation grant, this one for $370,000.\n\"We have been able to make a very valid argument that small institutions, with small pots of money, can still make significant impacts on their communities \u2014 so that we become a model for other institutions that are small, who can see the value in a $20,000 initial investment\" that can then lead to realization of larger dreams.\nSince spring 2012, the college has placed 93 student interns, including at NASA, Orbital ATK, LJT, Buchanan Subaru, Tyson Foods, Perdue Farms, the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport, Eastern Shore Rural Health, Blue Crab Bay and other companies.\nMany of the internships resulted in full-time employment at the companies for the students.\n\"So we are helping to build the workforce here on the Shore. These internships provide opportunities for our students to see what it's really like in the workplace,\" Thomas-Glover said.\nThe latest grant is to develop a Technical Scholars Program \u2014 the basic idea is for the college to partner with local high schools to train young people in technical fields.\nAn advisory committee, whose membership include community business leaders, is helping the college develop a curriculum for the program over the next year.\n\"We're very excited about having members of the community come in and be a part of that process,\" Thomas-Glover said.\nThe Technical Scholars Program will be helped immensely by having the new, up-to-date building on campus.\n\"That's the beauty of the timing of the building \u2014 we are going to have state-of-the-art equipment in there \u2014 a welding lab, entirely new. ... We will be the latest and the greatest,\" she said, noting Northampton County High School in particular is interested in partnering in a dual enrollment welding program.\n\"Those labs are so expensive that there's no reason to duplicate that,\" she said.\nThe building will include a dedicated technical programs innovation laboratory, which is a flexible space that will allow the college to bring in many different kinds of technical and manufacturing training.\n\"So it's really an exciting time,\" Thomas-Glover said, citing financial and moral support from the community, including from the two Shore counties' boards of supervisors, for enabling the college's progress and the new building.\nRELATED Hope finally fulfilled: Eastern Shore Community College marks construction project\nStill, for Thomas-Glover, with the new building underway, the time is right for her to move on to a new position.\n\"In life, there are stages in which you plant, you water and you harvest. I look at that building \u2014 the planting and starting to water \u2014 now someone else can step in and finish that and do the harvest,\" she said, adding, \"Everyone can feel pride in what we're doing with that building, because it has come as the result of the contributions of many.\"\nThe next stage for Thomas-Glover's career will be a position as liaison to individual colleges throughout the region covered by the accrediting agency SACSCOC, in which she will serve as a resource to help them prepare for accreditation renewal.\nShe will work with about 30 institutions a year, both two- and four-year colleges, in the Southern region.\nThomas-Glover in the past has served on the board and the executive board of SACSCOC and since 1993 has been involved in visits to colleges.\nFor her, it is a logical progression.\nShe started out as an assistant professor in chemistry at Bennett College in Greensboro, North Carolina.\nThen she became a department chair, then a division chair and then provost at a Kentucky community college, before coming to Eastern Shore Community College.\n\"My heart is still as a faculty member,\" she said, but noted as an administrator, her sphere of influence broadened.\nIn her new job, it will be broader still, affecting multiple institutions of higher education.\n\"The ability to impact and affect students' success ... a lot of it lies in the policies,\" she said.\nStill, she will miss the little college in Melfa.\n\"This is a great institution and there are great people here,\" she said.\nThomas-Glover in the coming years will recall Eastern Shore Community College fondly as \u2014 in the words of Glenn DuBois, Virginia Community College System chancellor, used in congratulating the college on receiving a National Science Foundation grant \u2014 \"small but mighty.\"\n\"That's what I think we are \u2014 we may be small, but we are mighty in terms of our outcomes and how we impact and partner with our community,\" Thomas-Glover said.\nREAD MORE Onancock bridge closed for months for $746K repair project\nOn Twitter @cvvaughnESN\n443-260-3314",

        "text": "Artist Marilee Shapiro Asher, who turns 103 on Tuesday, is still making art at her apartment in her retirement home in Washington. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)\nEveryone asks the centenarians: \"What's your secret?\"\nThe answer is pretty simple: work.\nIn her sun-drenched studio at a Washington retirement home, Marilee Shapiro Asher has a hot wax knife, a handsaw, a hacksaw, plaster molds and bronze pieces at her worktable. There are also prints everywhere, because she's on a photography binge, and she's finally experimenting with color.\n\"I've always been afraid of color,\" she said. \"So I'm working on that right now.\"\nHer digital prints are playful, abstract takes on soap bubbles, flowers and shadows. Over the years, she has worked in ceramics, bronze, paper and steel. Her last show was in 2012 at Gallery Plan B, which closed on 14th Street NW a few months ago.\nMabel Sawhill, center, a 102-year-old caterer, talks with guests during a lunch at the Bethesda Women's Club. (Paula Eve/Paula Eve)\nA short drive away, in Silver Spring, Mabel Sawhill put the finishing touches on a luncheon she was serving to 50 members of the Bethesda Women's Club \u2014 turkey, mashed potatoes, kale salad, vegetables and her famous sticky buns. But she also was fretting about the funeral of a 97-year-old family friend she was attending afterward.\n\"They were going to just serve cake and coffee, and that's just not right,\" she explained. So at 3 a.m., she made sandwiches. A couple hundred little ones.\nThe caterer is 102 years old. And Marilee, who often uses a walker but is otherwise in good health, turns 103 Tuesday. They're both lively and engaged, voracious consumers of life. And they're still working.\nThe number of American centenarians is growing \u2014 it has nearly doubled in the past 30 years, to nearly 55,000 today. People are living longer. Longevity isn't the challenge it once was. But living fully in that second century still is.\n[This is your brain on retirement \u2014 not nearly as sharp, studies say]\nSo that's why people such as Marilee and Mabel are so fascinating. (There's something else about centenarians \u2014 they ascend to single-name status and insist on it.)\nMabel, who was born in 1913, when Woodrow Wilson was president, launched her catering business when she was \u2014 wait for it \u2014 70.\nMarilee Shapiro Asher holds the wax model for casting for her piece \"Guard Dog Big.\" She has been a working artist all her life and remains active. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)\nShe had been doing it on the side for decades while working as an administrative assistant at the Navy's Bureau of Medicine and Surgery. She was a schoolteacher in her native Iowa until World War II, when she decided that \"everybody was doing their part, and I thought I should do something for my country.\" So she moved to Silver Spring and took that government job.\nIn 1983, Mabel retired from her federal desk job and started catering full time. She does about 100 events a year \u2014 weddings, funerals, social clubs, a summer church camp in West Virginia. She does her own grocery shopping and did her own driving until last year. She accepts some driving help now, calling it an efficiency measure.\nShe has never needed eyeglasses and was able to read some small print that I had to get my specs out to see.\nThere is a small group of people who have had Mabel cater both their weddings and their 50th wedding anniversaries. She insisted on catering her own 100th birthday party. They expected 450 people. Seven hundred showed up.\n\"When we realized that we had about 700 people, I ran out and started cutting the meatballs in half,\" she remembered.\nShe loves shoes and still treasures the black-and-yellow polka-dot pumps she bought years ago at the now-defunct Garfinckel's department store. She loves sports, putting together a March Madness NCAA basketball bracket every year. Her goal before her 103rd birthday next October is to join a fantasy football league. And she's a deeply religious member of Wallace Presbyterian Church in College Park who asks God for guidance every day.\nMabel's version of The Secret?\n\"I never married,\" she said.\nBut she helped put her deaf brother through Gallaudet University, helped send nieces and nephews to college and raised more than $30,000 for a scholarship fund at Gallaudet.\nMarilee, on the other hand, had two husbands and two children. She calls them \"the center, the interest, the worry, the pleasure, the \u2018raison d'\u00eatre' of my life,\" in her autobiography, \"Dancing in the Wonder.\"\nAre they her Secret?\n\"Being selfish\" \u2014 that's her key to aging so vivaciously, she told me. \"And exercise.\"\nShe's been doing tai chi every day for decades. And she's always worked, even when her children were young and other women didn't work.\n\"I had to be selfish in order to keep making art,\" she said.\nMarilee's daughter once wondered whether it was Geneva \u2014 the family housekeeper/cook/nanny \u2014 who primarily raised her. But they came to agree that Marilee's work as an artist was an important part of her daughter's upbringing, too.\nMarilee had her first show in Chicago in 1938, and her work was sold in Washington galleries for decades. She was on staff at American University and spent years as an art therapist at the National Institute of Mental Health.\nShe never let her art self be suffocated by her Mom self.\nIn her late 80s, when she began having difficulty moving and working with large, heavy bronze sculptures, Marilee didn't retire. She found a new medium \u2014 digital. She enrolled in a Corcoran class on digital photography at 88. Her classmates were all in their 20s. But she learned to use a computer, to use Photoshop, to create a Web site. All alongside students nearly 70 years younger.\nThat's another thing about reaching 100. Marilee and Mabel have outlived just about all their peers.\nMabel's friends have all asked her to cater their funerals, so she does a lot of those. Last week she told me she had to find a new lawyer because she outlived her old one.\nMarilee outlived the last gallery that showed her work. She's open to finding a new one.\nSlowing down? Not for these two.",

        "text": "@fspielman | email\nFired Chicago Police Supt. Garry McCarthy said Tuesday he proudly accepted a $5,600 campaign contribution from former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, but will not be dragged into a discussion about Giuliani\u2019s support for President Donald Trump.\nThe $5,600 contribution from the politician, who earned the nickname \u201cAmerica\u2019s Mayor\u201d after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, came as McCarthy inches closer to a 2019 race for mayor against Rahm Emanuel.\n\u201cRudy Giuliani has been a friend and a mentor to me for more than 20 years. I was with him on 9/11. He\u2019s the guy who turned New York City in the direction that it\u2019s still going in. Maybe Chicago should pay attention,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\u201cI\u2019m happy and proud that he supports me and thinks that I can do a job like this. You don\u2019t abandon your friends because of their politics. It has nothing to do with his politics,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has to do with the fact that I worked for the guy for two years. Loyalty. Try it, Chicago.\u201d\nMcCarthy said the Giuliani contribution \u201cmeans that America\u2019s mayor respects my ability to run a city. The guy knows me very well and knows what I\u2019m capable of. It\u2019s no deeper than that.\u201d\nAs hard as Emanuel and his surrogates may try, McCarthy said he will not be drawn into a discussion about Trump or about Giuliani\u2019s outspoken support for Trump, particularly during a fiery speech at the Republican National Convention.\nReferring to his role as chief crime strategist in the New York Police Department, McCarthy said, \u201cIt would be impossible for me to have been in my position in New York and not have known Donald Trump. So, for him to say something positive about me \u2014 suddenly I [am no good]? Come on. I also know Cory Booker, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Janet Napolitano. I mean \u2014 stop. It\u2019s just stupid.\u201d\nMcCarthy said he\u2019s \u201cbeen a Democrat from the day I could vote\u201d and he \u201cshouldn\u2019t have to\u201d explain whether he is for or against Trump \u2014 not even in this overwhelmingly Democratic city.\n\u201cRahm makes everything a diversion. Let\u2019s talk about global warming, instead of violence on the South Side of Chicago \u2014 what he\u2019s actually accountable for. That\u2019s the game he plays. I\u2019m just not gonna play into it,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\u201cIf Donald Trump is gonna come and fix Chicago, let\u2019s talk about him. Otherwise, let\u2019s stop the nonsense. Let\u2019s talk about bullets flying on the South and West Side and what anybody in this city is doing about it right now. . . . Do we want to talk about Brexit at the same time? That has as much to do with what\u2019s happening in Chicago as Donald Trump.\u201d\nMcCarthy has scheduled a Feb. 11 fundraiser and set up an interactive website that will be used to raise money. He\u2019s awaiting results of a poll that will help him decide whether to challenge the mayor who fired him.\nAld. Pat O\u2019Connor (40th), Emanuel\u2019s City Council floor leader, said if McCarthy decides to enter the race, he will be forced to explain to Chicago voters whether Trump\u2019s flattering remarks about McCarthy signal a mutual admiration society.\n\u201cOf course he\u2019s gonna have to answer for that because Trump has become an obsession with everyone. He keeps the entire country on edge,\u201d O\u2019Connor said.\n\u201cTo the extent that people have great concerns about the presidency and what it does to the average American on a daily basis, and you look at Chicago and where the majority of the sentiments of people exist \u2014 he\u2019s gonna have to clarify one way or the other.\u201d\nAld. Ameya Pawar (47th) was even more outspoken about what he perceives as McCarthy\u2019s ties to Trump and possible mayoral challenger Paul Vallas\u2019 ties to Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner.\n\u201cYou have one person who\u2019s best known for privatizing public education in New Orleans after one of the country\u2019s most horrific natural disasters. Then, you have a former police superintendent who swears by broken windows and failed policing strategies and has been very nice to Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani,\u201d said Pawar, who hasn\u2019t ruled out a race for mayor himself.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what percentage Trump got in the city, but it\u2019s probably about the same as Bruce Rauner. . . . If I was Rahm Emanuel and I had to run against Bruce Rauner or Donald Trump in the next mayoral race, I\u2019d be pretty happy about it.\u201d\nVallas could not be reached for comment. He was Democrat Pat Quinn\u2019s running mate for lieutenant governor in 2014 only to become Rauner\u2019s choice to turn around Chicago State University. That\u2019s a job Vallas lost earlier this week because of his flirtation with mayoral politics.",

        "text": "President Trump is a book genre unto himself. There's \u201cUnderstanding Trump,\u201d by Newt Gingrich, whom Trump considered as a running mate; \u201cLet Trump Be Trump,\u201d by former Trump campaign aides Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie; \u201cThe Swamp,\u201d by former Fox News Channel host Eric Bolling; and a forthcoming book by former White House press secretary Sean Spicer (working title: \u201cThe Briefing\u201d).\nNote that all of these authors are pro-Trump partisans. That's why Michael Wolff's \u201cFire and Fury,\u201d out Jan. 9, is significant. Wolff, a longtime journalist who has written for Vanity Fair, the Guardian, the Hollywood Reporter and other publications, presents his new title as a major piece of reporting.\nWolff says that his book is based on 200 conversations over the past 18 months with Trump, most members of his senior staff, some of whom he talked to dozens of times, and many people with whom they had spoken. Some conversations were on the record, while others were off the record or on \u201cdeep background,\u201d allowing him to relay a \u201cdisembodied description of events provided by an unnamed witness to them.\u201d\nHe notes that many accounts he heard of the Trump White House conflicted one another. In some cases, Wolff says, he let the players offer competing versions of reality while in other cases, he said that \u201cthrough a consistency in accounts and through sources I have come to trust, settled on a version of events I believe to be true.\u201d\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Wednesday that \u201cthis book is filled with false and misleading accounts from individuals who have no access or influence with the White House.\u201d\n\u201cFire and Fury\u201d contains many interesting insights and claims, big and small. Some are new; others are familiar but bolstered by additional color and detail. Here are 12 that stand out:\nTrump thought he would lose the election\nKey excerpt: In politics somebody has to lose, but invariably everybody thinks they can win. And you probably can\u2019t win unless you believe that you will win \u2014 except in the Trump campaign. The leitmotif for Trump about his own campaign was how crappy it was and how everybody involved in it was a loser. He was equally convinced that rival Hillary Clinton's people were brilliant winners \u2014 \u201cThey\u2019ve got the best and we\u2019ve got the worst,\u201d he frequently said. Time spent with Trump on the campaign plane was often an epic dissing experience: Everybody around him was an idiot.\nStephen K. Bannon thought Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer was 'treasonous'\nKey excerpt: \u201cThe chance that Don Jr. did not walk these jumos up to his father\u2019s office on the twenty-sixth floor is zero,\u201d said an astonished and derisive [Stephen K.] Bannon, not long after the meeting was revealed. \u201cThe three senior guys in the campaign,\u201d an incredulous Bannon went on, \u201cthought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside Trump Tower in the conference room on the twenty-fifth floor \u2014 with no lawyers. They didn\u2019t have any lawyers. Even if you thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad s--t, and I happen to think it\u2019s all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately.\u201d\n(Washington Post reporters have found no evidence that Trump met with the Russians during this meeting at Trump Tower. The president fired back at Bannon on Wednesday, saying in a statement that \u201cSteve pretends to be at war with the media, which he calls the opposition party, yet he spent his time at the White House leaking false information to the media to make himself seem far more important than he was. It is the only thing he does well. Steve was rarely in a one-on-one meeting with me and only pretends to have had influence to fool a few people with no access and no clue, whom he helped write phony books.\u201d)\nTrump asked Roger Ailes to lead the campaign, and Ailes declined\nKey excerpt: In early August [2016], less than a month after Ailes had been ousted from Fox News, Trump asked his old friend to take over the management of his calamitous campaign. Ailes, knowing Trump\u2019s disinclination to take advice, or even listen to it, turned him down.\nTrump didn't know who John Boehner was\nKey excerpt: \u201cYou need a son of a b---h as your chief of staff. And you need a son of a b---h who knows Washington,\u201d Ailes told Trump not long after the election. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to be your own son of a b---h, but you don\u2019t know Washington.\u201d Ailes had a suggestion: \u201cSpeaker Boehner.\u201d (John Boehner had been the speaker of the House until he was forced out in a tea party putsch in 2015.) \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d Trump asked.\nReince Priebus froze after the 'Access Hollywood' tape leaked\nKey excerpt: So mortifying was this development that when Reince Priebus, the RNC head, was called to New York from Washington for an emergency meeting at Trump Tower, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to leave Penn Station. It took two hours for the Trump team to coax him across town. \u201cBro,\u201d said a desperate Bannon, cajoling Priebus on the phone, \u201cI may never see you again after today, but you gotta come to this building and you gotta walk through the front door.\u201d\nMelania Trump dreaded becoming first lady\nKey excerpt: The New York Post got its hands on outtakes from a nude photo shoot that Melania had done early in her modeling career \u2014 a leak that everybody other than Melania assumed could be traced back to Trump himself. Inconsolable, she confronted her husband. Is this the future? She told him she wouldn\u2019t be able to take it. Trump responded in his fashion \u2014 We\u2019ll sue! \u2014 and set her up with lawyers. But he was uncharacteristically contrite, too. Just a little longer, he told her. It would all be over in November.

The details of the contested legislation were, to him, particularly boring; his attention would begin wandering from the first words of a policy discussion. . . . Prior to his presidency, he had likely never had a meaningful discussion in his life about health insurance.\nIvanka Trump has presidential ambitions of her own\nKey excerpt: Jared [Kushner] and Ivanka had made an earnest deal between themselves: If some time in the future the time came, she\u2019d be the one to run for president (or the first one of them to take the shot). The first woman president, Ivanka entertained, would not be Hillary Clinton, it would be Ivanka Trump.\nIvanka sometimes made fun of her father's hair, in private\nKey excerpt: She often described the mechanics behind it to friends: an absolutely clean pate \u2014 a contained island after scalp reduction surgery \u2014 surrounded by a furry circle of hair around the sides and front, from which all ends are drawn up to meet in the center and then swept back and secured by a stiffening spray. The color, she would point out to comical effect, was from a product called Just for Men \u2014 the longer it was left on, the darker it got.

Bannon: O\u2019Reilly and Hannity are in, what about you? Ailes, in secret, had been plotting his comeback with a new conservative network. . . .

        "text": "Among the many pieces of legislation circulating around Sacramento these days is Assembly Bill 1671, a contentious measure introduced by Assemblyman Jimmy Gomez, D-Los Angeles, that would make it a crime to secretly record communications with a \u201chealth care provider,\u201d which would include abortion clinics.\nUnder the bill, first-time violators may be subject to up to three years in jail and a $2,500 fine, and subsequent violations may result in up to three years imprisonment and a $10,000 fine. The legislation is sponsored by Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California, and was prompted by the 2015 hidden-camera recordings released by the anti-abortion Center for Medical Progress which showed Planned Parenthood employees cavalierly discussing the sale of aborted fetus parts. Planned Parenthood noted that there was a marked increase in threats and violence against its clinics after the release of the videos, which it blamed, in part, on the rapid and widespread distribution made available by the internet.\nBut just because technology makes communication cheaper and easier, and offers access to a wider audience than before, this does not mean that the First Amendment should be suspended. After all, who is to determine how many people must see or hear a message \u2013 and how quickly \u2013 before constitutional rights may be curtailed?\nThe bill originally also made it a crime for one to \u201caid and abet\u201d in the distribution of such recorded materials, meaning that, for example, journalists who obtained such recordings could have been prosecuted for simply distributing the material. Thankfully, that provision has been stricken from the bill, as it was unconstitutional on its face.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has dealt with such issues multiple times, including the 1971 New York Times Co. v. United States decision, which upheld the paper\u2019s right to publish the classified Pentagon Papers, and the 2001 Bartnicki v. Vopper decision, which upheld a radio station\u2019s right to air an illegally recorded cellphone conversation between a teachers union president and chief negotiator, which included a threat of violence if the union\u2019s demands were not met in contract negotiations.\nAB1671 remains objectionable even without the \u201caiding and abetting\u201d provision, however. The bill \u201cis unclear and CNPA continues to vigorously oppose it,\u201d the California Newspaper Publishers Association contended in a legislative bulletin. \u201cAdditionally, newspapers could still be criminally charged under general aiding and abetting criminal law principles. This is especially true if it is unclear who made and distributed the recording to the media, and the publisher is the only known entity for the prosecutor to charge.\u201d\nMoreover, the bill still offers no protection to whistleblowers, except where \u201cthe parties to the communication may reasonably expect that the communication may be overheard and recorded,\u201d or in the collection of evidence of certain serious or violent crimes. As Electronic Frontier Foundation senior counsel Adam Schwartz told Courthouse News Service, when the right of privacy and the freedom of speech come into conflict, \u201c[I]t\u2019s important that we write laws with a scalpel.\u201d AB1671 resorts to using a clever, and should be rejected by the Legislature or Gov. Jerry Brown.",

The City Section champions rallied to defeat Pittsburg 28-21.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI always say you don\u2019t win at halftime. You don\u2019t win at the first or second quarters. Our boys played four quarters,\u201d Coach Manuel Douglas said.\nDown 21-0, Narbonne finally took the lead with 8:25 left when quarterback Jalen Chatman, on fourth and goal, connected with Aaron Magee on a seven-yard touchdown pass for a 22-21 advantage.\n\u201cHe struggled tonight but he made the biggest play of our season,\u201d Douglas said of Chatman.\nPittsburg (9-3) tried to take the lead on a 36-yard field goal attempt with less than five minutes left. But the snap was fumbled and Logan Taylor picked it up and ran 70 yards for the touchdown. Then Demontii Peoples clinched the win with an interception.\nAdvertisement\nNarbonne (12-3), which has won four consecutive City Section championships and two state bowl game titles in the past four seasons, turned in a dominating second-half defensive performance behind linebackers Darien Butler, Raymond Scott and Julian Lewis. Butler and Scott have started for four seasons and will have so many rings they\u2019ll need both hands to display them all.\nThen there was running back Jermar Jefferson.

Grace Brethren (14-2), with only five seniors on its roster, scored on its opening possession with the wind when freshman Seven McGee ran 43 yards for a touchdown.\nWilliams caught a 31-yard touchdown pass from Vettel in the second quarter following a blocked punt, and a two-point conversion put Saint Francis up 8-7. Opeti Fangupo later scored on a one-yard run for a 15-7 lead.\nThen Grace Brethren freshman quarterback Michael Zele surprised Saint Francis, passing against the wind to Jermel Jones for a 72-yard touchdown.\nToday's Headlines Newsletter",

        "text": "Updated on September 11, 2017 On a hot summer day in Nevada City, California, a group of teenage girls are scattered before a stage in the town\u2019s cultural center. They\u2019re studying an analog soundboard, which is covered with so many knobs and levers that it looks like it belongs in the cockpit of an airplane. Onstage, a band is doing a sound check, which requires lots of drumming, strumming, and saying \u201ccheck\u201d into a microphone. \u201cCheck is a really annoying word,\u201d the guitar player says. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s losing all meaning,\u201d the bassist replies. It\u2019s the last day of the week-long Live Sound Camp for Girls. This afternoon, there will be a show, but the band won\u2019t be the real focus. Rather, the performance will be a chance for 16 girls\u2014and a few boys\u2014to show off the live music-production skills they\u2019ve learned by controlling all the technical aspects of the concert on their own. The camp\u2019s instructor, Tiffany Hendren, hovers by the soundboard as the teenagers take turns with the headphones. One participant, 17-year-old Mary Vogel, explains the intricacies of micing a drum set to me. \u201cYou\u2019re creating something live right in front of you,\u201d she says of sound engineering. \u201cYou\u2019re making it richer. You\u2019re taking out the little buzzes and snaps and things you just don\u2019t want to hear because it takes away from the performance.\u201d Vogel, who has spent two summers at the camp, says she\u2019s considering taking music-production classes in college next year.\nSound Camp, which has events in California as well as St. Louis, Philadelphia, and New York, is part of SoundGirls.org, an organization co-founded by Karrie Keyes, the live-sound engineer for Pearl Jam. Keyes tells me she started the camp to encourage girls and introduce them to potential careers in audio. \u201cIt lets them get their hands on the gear before anyone can discourage them or frighten them away,\u201d she says. How artists navigate their industries, hone their craft, and make a living\nRead more Keyes works in a profession that has long been notoriously dominated by men. In 2000, the Audio Engineering Society\u2019s (AES) women in audio committee\u2014which is now, tellingly, defunct\u2014loosely estimated that 5 percent of those working in the field were female. A 2016 survey by AES found 7 percent of its members were women, though that number is incomplete because participants could opt out of reporting their gender. According to Women\u2019s Audio Mission (WAM), a nonprofit that trains women for sound careers, that number is probably lower. With men holding the vast majority of technical jobs in audio, it follows that virtually all the music we hear\u2014on the radio, over headphones, or in a live venue\u2014has been shaped by a man. Women like Hendren and Keyes spend many years mastering their craft. When she\u2019s not teaching at Sound Camp, Hendren is a full-time sound engineer who works for venues in St. Louis and tours with bands. Hendren got her start by spending five years as a monitor engineer, which means she was in charge of what artists hear on stage. Her venue saw 150 to 175 shows a year, but she says she can count on one hand the number of female sound engineers she met during that time.\n\u201cThe guys who worked at the venue were great,\u201d Hendren says of The Pageant in St. Louis. \u201cBut I always felt like I had to be a little bit better at my job than they were. And then when I started talking to other women, and had that feeling confirmed, it was like, \u2018Okay, I\u2019m not imagining this. This really is taking me a lot more effort than it\u2019s taking that guy over there.\u2019\u201d Hendren says she has lost work for being a woman; in one case, she was rejected for a job because the band\u2019s wives were uncomfortable with a woman being on the bus. Teaching at Sound Camp has been life-changing for Hendren. When she describes the first time she saw the girls run a show without her help, she tears up. \u201cIt was so great,\u201d Hendren says. \u201cIt was really amazing to feel like I did something for someone that no one was able to do for me.\u201d * * * It is important to note that, despite the challenges, women have been producing music for decades. In the 1950s, when Cordell Jackson (nicknamed \u201cthe rock-and-roll granny\u201d) couldn\u2019t break into Sun Records, she started her own Memphis-based label, Moon Records, likely making her the first female record producer and engineer in the U.S. Other early women producers include Bonnie Guitar, whose label made hits like The Fleetwoods\u2019s \u201cCome Softly to Me,\u201d and Sylvia Moy, who produced Motown acts and worked with Stevie Wonder. Ellie Greenwich co-wrote and co-produced hits like \u201cChapel of Love\u201d and \u201cLeader of the Pack.\u201d Sylvia Robinson, known as the \u201cgodmother of hip-hop,\u201d started Sugar Hill Records, which put out the seminal track \u201cRapper\u2019s Delight\u201d in 1979.\nToday, prominent female producers include Sylvia Massy, Sally Browder, Leslie Ann Jones, and Kara DioGuardi. There\u2019s the rapper Missy Elliott, who has built a well-regarded career as a producer; Linda Perry from 4 Non Blondes, who has worked with artists like Pink and Christina Aguilera; and Tokimonsta, a classically trained pianist who has worked with Kelly Rowland. Still younger rising stars include WondaGurl, a Canadian beatmaker who has been producing since she was 9 years old and who famously worked with Jay-Z when she was 16. \u201cEven Bj\u00f6rk had to come out and say, \u2018I produce my own stuff ... I just happened to work with a man.\u2019\u201d The impressive individual accomplishments of these women, however, don\u2019t change the overall systemic picture\u2014the fact that list after list from music publications ranking top producers often don\u2019t include a single woman. Billboard\u2019s 2016 Power 100 list only has 14 women on it, with none in the top 10. No woman has won the Grammy for Producer of the Year (Non-Classical). In the award\u2019s 43-year history, there have been only six women nominees for that category: Janet Jackson, Mariah Carey, Paula Cole, Lauryn Hill, Sheryl Crow, and Lauren Christy, who worked with Liz Phair and Hilary Duff. As the last set of examples suggests, when a woman is lauded for her producing skills, she\u2019s usually also a well-known performer. Men, on the other hand, are more likely to be touted for their musical technical prowess alone, according to several female engineers I spoke with. \u201cIt\u2019s always a sexy woman performing ... a sexy woman singing who\u2019s produced by an amazing man behind the glass,\u201d says Leslie Gaston-Bird, the AES vice president for western USA/Canada. \u201cEven Bj\u00f6rk had to come out and say, \u2018I produce my own stuff. ... I just happened to work with a man.\u2019\u201d\nWomen in audio deal with unique challenges that come from working within a cross-section of two traditionally male-dominated fields. Because of the technical nature of their jobs, they experience issues similar to those many women in STEM\u2014science, technology, engineering, and math\u2014face, such as struggling for respect and being second-guessed by their peers. On top of that are the added pressures of the competitive and fickle music industry. Historically, audio engineering has relied on apprenticeships: An established engineer will find a younger person with potential and interest, take him under his wing, and teach him the job. Such mentorships foster loyalty but can also end up shutting women out of the field. \u201c[The apprenticeship model] gives young women a challenge because it\u2019s less likely that an older [male] engineer is going to see himself in a young woman,\u201d says Susan Rogers, a professor at Berklee College of Music who was also the sound engineer on Prince\u2019s Purple Rain. \u201cSo it\u2019s another barrier of entry.\u201d Since training an engineer from scratch is a lot of work, the industry is increasingly turning to colleges to teach audio professionals. Which brings up another possible reason for the lack of female producers: Women don\u2019t take as many music-engineering classes. At Berklee, for example, only 15 to 20 percent of students in engineering classes are women, Rogers says. According to an AES convention paper presented in 2016, male students regularly outnumbered female students 5 to 1 at the Recording Engineers Institute in New York. This year, the University of Colorado\u2019s Recording Arts Program reported seeing 45 female applicants compared to 170 male applicants.*\nIt\u2019s possible, too, that women aren\u2019t going into audio because they don\u2019t know these careers exist. When Gaston-Bird interviewed women in the industry about their careers, she found that the majority learned about their jobs by accident, by going to shows and talking to people who work with bands. (This awareness problem, to be fair, can apply to men as well.) But this still doesn\u2019t explain why, when women do know about audio engineering, they tend to choose other career paths in music instead. While there are few studies on the issue, the little data there is suggests this disparity starts young. In 2014, researchers at the University of Colorado, led by Gaston-Bird, asked 36 students (18 male, 18 female) at a Denver secondary school what music-related careers they were interested in. The results were divided along gender lines between technical and nontechnical careers. While both groups wanted to be artists, the girls were also interested in being sound designers, music therapists, songwriters, teachers, and composers. The boys wanted to work in sound design and mixing, electronic-music programming, audio software design, producing, and recording engineering. Terri Winston, the executive director of WAM, says she believes women don\u2019t go into audio partly because of how young girls are first exposed to technology. When women don\u2019t play with tools or learn to build things as children, they can lack interest or confidence in using those skills as adults. \u201cIt\u2019s not just our industry,\u201d Winston tells me. \u201cWe have a very serious problem in this country in how we socialize women in technology and in leadership positions in general.\u201d \u201cI think the overt behavior has improved as of late. However, the underlying bias is still very much evident.\u201d Winston herself got to dodge this particular roadblock: Her father was a mechanical engineer who encouraged her to tinker with his equipment when she was growing up. At WAM, she tries to foster a similar sense of curiosity by exposing her students to different audio technologies in the \u201chope something sticks.\u201d So far, it has: In 14 years, WAM has placed more than 400 women in sound-related jobs with companies like Dolby Laboratories, Pixar, Google, and Electronic Arts.\n*** Once women secure jobs in audio, they can still grapple with sexist remarks, condescension, and unfair performance standards\u2014as a recent discussion on the AES Facebook page illuminates. \u201cThis last 3 years I\u2019ve spent designing and building a recording studio from scratch, and not a day has gone by where I haven\u2019t experienced sexism,\u201d one poster wrote. \u201cI waste so much of my time on proving myself in ways that the men around me are never challenged on,\u201d another said. Emily Lazar is a mastering engineer who has been nominated for three Grammys and has worked with thousands of musicians, including Sia, David Bowie, and Bj\u00f6rk. In an email, she explains that when she was coming up in her field in the \u201990s she had few options for dealing with sexism at work. \u201cIf you did not just go along with a lot of the behavior, you would at least be excluded from sessions and your position threatened,\u201d Lazar says. \u201cI think the overt behavior has improved as of late. However, the underlying bias is still very much evident.\u201d Difficulties that women face in other jobs are only amplified in a heavily gender-skewed field like audio. Getting pregnant and having children can come with career-defining consequences. The hours are long and unpredictable, which can take a toll on family life, and there\u2019s a constant pressure to stay relevant: In the competitive music world, even a brief hiatus can open the door for someone else to take your job. \u201cThere\u2019s no taking time off and saying, \u2018Here\u2019s my replacement,\u2019\u201d says the sound engineer Shani Gandhi, who at 29 has already won a Grammy for Best Folk Album as engineer on Sarah Jarosz\u2019s album Undercurrent. \u201cIf you don\u2019t work, you\u2019re not making money.\u201d This lack of stability makes it even more financially risky to have a family. Most audio professionals are self-employed, which means health care comes out-of-pocket, and there are no benefits like paid maternity leave.",

The GOP claims to be for jobs and economic prosperity for all, but this action shows otherwise.\"\n\u2014Jess Phoenix, California congressional candidateThat was how one commentator described a pair of provisions buried in the GOP tax plan that passed the House on Thursday and is likely headed to the Senate floor for a vote as early as next week.\nOne provision\u2014crammed in the middle of the latest version of the so-called \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\"\u2014would provide a windfall to the wealthy few who own or lease private planes by exempting them from certain taxes related to \"maintenance and support,\" \"the hiring and training of pilots and crew,\" and \"administrative services such as scheduling, flight planning, weather forecasting, obtaining insurance, and establishing and complying with safety standards.\"\nGraduate students, however, would not fare so well if the GOP plan becomes law.\nAs CNBC reports, \"[s]ome programs provide graduate students with a modest stipend for food and housing. For instance, Ryan Hill, a fourth-year Ph.D. student at MIT, receives a $30,000 living stipend and a tuition waiver allowing him to forego paying $50,000 in tuition. He currently pays taxes on his $30,000 stipend, but under the proposed House tax bill, his tuition waiver would also be taxed\u2014meaning he would be taxed as if he was earning $80,000 a year.\"\nIn total, the House GOP tax plan would raise taxes by 400 percent on many graduate students, the Harvard Crimson estimated.\nSuch a tax on students who are already drowning in loan debt \"would be devastating,\" Samantha Hernandez, legislative director of the National Association of Graduate-Professional Students, told Wired. \"I monitor all legislation at the state and federal levels that could affect graduate and professional students, and this is just\u2014this would have the greatest negative impact of anything I've seen.\"\nHistorian Nick Kapur pointed to his own experience as a PhD student and described the proposed tax hike as \"the height of Republican insanity.\"\nWhen I was a PhD student, my stipend was just $18,000 and my waived tuition was $55,000. Taxing someone who only receives $18,000 the same amount as someone who earns $73,000 in order to give billionaires a huge cut is the height of Republican insanity.https://t.co/zkTt5cQ7oG \u2014 Nick Kapur (@nick_kapur) November 16, 2017\nOther students, professors, and analysts weighed in on social media, denouncing the proposed tax hike as \"an assault on the value of knowledge\" that would \"make graduate study impossible for everyone who isn\u2019t already wealthy.\"\nAll of this, just to give more money to corporations & wealthy people who are already doing just fine...record profits for corps & gains for the stock market. Combine this new grad student tax with losing the student loan interest deduction & we can see where this is going. 5/ \u2014 Jess Phoenix (@jessphoenix2018) November 16, 2017",

        "text": "The Year Late Night Got Serious\n5:30 AM 12/22/2017\nby Patrick Shanley\nA look back at the issues, scandals and tragedies of 2017 that brought politics to the forefront in nightly comics' acts across the dial.\nFrom left to right: Courtesy of ABC, NBC and CBS\nA statement likely uttered every December: \"It's been quite a year.\"\nHowever rote those words may seem, 2017 certainly lends them merit. From the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history to raging health care debates to white nationalists, KKK members and Nazis marching on Charlottesville, Virginia, to numerous sexual harassment allegations, there was more than enough fodder for late-night hosts to tackle on their daily shows.\nWhile generally approached from a place of humor, some stories proved so serious, so sensitive, that late-night comics turned the knife and addressed social and political issues with anger, severity, criticism, sorrow and, of course, a twist of wit.\nHere's a look back at the year late night got serious.\nWeinstein Takedowns and Pulled Punches\nPerhaps nothing will be remembered more from 2017 than the swirl of sexual harassment allegations that embroiled Hollywood, Washington and beyond in the latter months of the year. What began with damning New York Times and New Yorker reports on disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein soon opened the door for accusations from women and men across the country against many high-profile names in media and politics.\nWhen the Weinstein news originally broke, late night hosts initially were silent on the issue, perhaps due to the timing of the report's release on a Thursday afternoon, shortly before or during filming for most late night programs (many shows also either don't air on Fridays or pre-tape Friday shows on Thursday). Whatever the case, some late night hosts, such as Jimmy Kimmel, initially addressed the news with much lighter gloves than previous scandals. Kimmel began his show on Oct. 9, the Monday of the week after the Times story published, by approaching the story hesitantly and without much time spent on the subject: \"I'm not sure if you know about this but there was an expos\u00e9 done in the New York Times about decades of sexual harassment accusations made about movie producer Harvey Weinstein, who is not the president and is not particularly well-known outside of L.A. and New York. The insinuation was that we, as part of the biased left-wing media wouldn't say anything about [Weinstein], because he's a Democrat. Never mind the thousands of jokes about Bill Cosby and Bill Clinton and all the other Bills of their ilk.\" He preceded these comments by addressing a Twitter spat with President Donald Trump's son, Donald Jr., and then immediately returned to that subject after his one Weinstein comment.\nThe Tonight Show's Jimmy Fallon similarly was light on the issue, as the host called Weinstein's behavior \"not good\" and made a single joke:\u00a0\"They said if [Weinstein] keeps it up, he'll wind up with his own show on Fox News.\"\nOther hosts, however, were much harsher in their takedown of Weinstein. Stephen Colbert referred to him as \"human Shrek\" and said that the disturbing allegations of sexual harassment amounted to \"monstrous behavior that in a just world would not have been allowed to go on for decades. It is indefensible.\" Meanwhile, NBC's Seth Meyers invited female members of his writing staff to address the scandal in their own segment. In part, they said, \"[Weinstein] blamed his disrespecting of women on the era he came from, which would be a good excuse if he came from a time machine.\"\nKimmel Takes on Health Care\nIn May, Kimmel revealed on-air in an emotional monologue that his newborn son had required emergency open-heart surgery shortly after his birth. Kimmel ended his tear-filled speech with a call for health care affordability which sparked a new political edge for the previously neutrally-inclined host.\nKimmel soon went to war with the GOP and President Trump's attempts to repeal Obamacare with the Graham-Cassidy health care bill. He criticized Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, one of the bill's author, for misleading him on his intentions on health care reform and then accusing Kimmel of \"not understanding\" policy. As with most others in late night, however, the majority of Kimmel's derision was aimed at Trump. \"I guarantee [Trump] doesn\u2019t know anything about this Graham-Cassidy bill. He doesn\u2019t know the difference between Medicare and Medicaid. He barely knows the difference between Melania and Ivanka!\" Kimmel quipped in September.\nThe host went hard at senators during his monologues, imploring them and citizens to vote down the Graham-Cassidy bill. Some criticized the host for his lobbying, claiming he was not qualified to comment on the issue. \"You know, a lot of people have been saying I\u2019m not qualified to talk about this. And that is true \u2014 I\u2019m not qualified to talk about this. But I think those people forget Bill Cassidy named his test after me!\" Kimmel responded, citing Cassidy's appearance on his show in May when the senator touted what he called \"the Jimmy Kimmel test,\" which Kimmel explains is an idea \u2014 which Cassidy said he would support in any future bills \u2014 that no child should be denied health care, emergency or otherwise, because the family cannot afford it.\nWhen the bill was voted down in late September, the host celebrated its defeat on his show: \u201cI haven't been so happy about something being dead since Bin Laden,\nLas Vegas Shooting & Gun Control Debate\nOn Oct. 1, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history occurred in Las Vegas when a gunman opened fire on an outdoor country music festival from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel. The following night, late night hosts addressed the senseless violence on their programs.\nKimmel, a Vegas native, opened his show on Oct. 2 with a teary monologue.\u00a0\"Here we are again in the aftermath of another terrible, inexplicable, shocking and painful tragedy \u2014 this time in Las Vegas, which happens to be my hometown. Of course, we pray for the victims and for their families and friends, and we wonder why, even though there's probably no way to ever know why a human being would do something like this to other human beings who were at a concert having fun, listening to music.\" He went on to call out \"our so-called leaders\" and question why they continue to allow these deadly acts of violence to occur. \"Maybe a better question \u2014 why do we continue to let them allow it to happen?\" the host asked. The host noted that his stance wasn't about gun control but about \"common sense,\" adding, \"Common sense says no good will ever come from allowing a person to have weapons that can take down 527 Americans at a concert. Common sense says you don\u2019t let those who suffer from mental illness buy guns.\"\nMeyers shared a similar sentiment on his program, saying,\u00a0\"It always seems like the worst displays of humanity in this country are immediately followed by the best, and then, sadly, that is followed by no action at all. And then it repeats itself.\" He then made a pointed statement to Congress: \"I would just like to say \u2014 are there no steps we can take as a nation to prevent gun violence? Or is this just how it is, and how it's going to continue to be?\"\nOn the Daily Show, host Trevor Noah also made a political cry for gun control, saying, \"\"To the people of Las Vegas, I can't give you thoughts and prayers. I can only say that I'm sorry. I'm sorry we live in a world where people will put a gun before your lives.\"\nOn TBS, Conan O'Brien expressed his sadness over the \"terrible and numbing\" tragedy, telling his audience, \"When I began in 1993, occasions like this were extremely rare. For me, or any TV comedy host, to come out and need to address a mass shooting spree was practically unheard of. Things have changed.\"\nAfter expressing his sorrow for the victims and families, Stephen Colbert took jabs at President Trump during his opening remarks, urging Trump to be the president to make a difference. \u201cToday, the president called this an \u2018act of pure evil.\u2019 And I think he\u2019s right,\u201d Colbert began. \u201cSo what, then are we willing to do to combat \u2018pure evil?\u2019 The answer can\u2019t be nothing.\u201d He further pressed the issue, saying, \"You want to make America great again? Do something the last two Presidents haven\u2019t been able to do. Pass any kind of common sense gun control legislation that the vast majority of Americans want. Think about what you need to do and pray for the courage to do it.\u201d\nCharlottesville & Trump's \"Many Sides\" Comment\nOn the weekend of August 12-13, white supremacists, KKK members, Nazis and more marched on downtown Charlottesville, Va. to protest the removal of a statue of Confederate leader Robert E. Lee. Opposing marches arrived and violence ensued, resulting in the death of one woman, Heather Heyer. Shortly thereafter, during a press conference, President Trump addressed the incident, of which he had been silent on Twitter over the weekend, and claimed there was violence on \"many sides,\" sparking backlash, and late night hosts addressed the \"shameful\" incident and Trump's comments on their shows that Monday night.\nColbert went after Trump's comments during his opening monologue, saying, \"Here's one thing that's not difficult to express: Nazis are bad. Many sides? Mr. President, this is terrorism, not your order at KFC.\" Colbert said he's seen \"angrier Yelp reviews\" than how Trump responded Saturday and said it was especially disturbing because his comments immediately following the tragedy made it hard for \"reasonable people\" to discern if he was condemning Nazis or not. He added that Trump is not a \"shrinking violet.\"\nMeyers began his show with a serious statement for Trump on his presidency, saying, \"The leader of our country is called the president because he's supposed to preside over our society. His job is to lead, to cajole, to scold, to correct our path, to lift up what is good about us, and to absolutely and unequivocally and immediately condemn what is evil in us. And if he does not do that and if he does not preside over our society, then he's not a president. You can stand for a nation or you can stand for a hateful movement \u2014 you can't do both.\" During his \"Closer Look\" segment, Meyers further dissected the president's remarks, which he called the lowest moment in Trump's presidency, saying that Americans \"shouldn't have to shame or pressure the president into saying Nazis are bad.\"\n\"This whole thing was such a bummer because Nazis were the last thing we all agreed on,\" said Meyers.\nOn the Tonight Show, Fallon also lambasted Trump for his delay in addressing the issue and his comments by referring to his daughters and what he wants for them. \"They need leaders who appeal to the best in us,\" Fallon said. \"The fact that it took the president two days to come out and clearly denounce racists and white supremacists is shameful.\"\nAs like his fellow late night contemporaries, Kimmel also criticized Trump for his statements. \"There were two sides, not many sides, and one of those sides had Nazis on it. All he had to do was condemn the Nazis, it shouldn't have been a difficult thing,\" the ABC host said.\nSexual Harassment Scandals\nWhat began with Weinstein quickly became a reckoning for many powerful figures in media. From Kevin Spacey to Matt Lauer to Charlie Rose to Sen. Al Franken to Senate candidate Roy Moore, hosts tackled the allegations night after night. On certain occasions, breaking news affected the guest lineups of the late night shows, as was the case when Jeremy Piven, accused of sexual assault, was dropped as a guest from The Late Show in early November, just days before he was scheduled to appear.\nIn late October, Spacey was the subject of a Buzzfeed expose in which\u00a0Star Trek: Discovery actor Anthony Rapp\u00a0Spacey of making a pass toward him when he was only 14. In response, Spacey tweeted his \"sincerest apology\" late Sunday night and came out as a gay man. His statement was met with backlash .\nThe Daily Show's Noah took aim at Spacey, ridiculing his apology.\u00a0\u201cTalk about the worst time to go public with your sexuality. I mean, it\u2019s always good to live your truth, but don\u2019t use it to get out of trouble,\" the host said. \u201cImagine if a cop pulled him over. He\u2019d be like \u2018Sir, are you drunk? I need you to come out of the vehicle.\u2019 He\u2019s like, \u2018That\u2019s not the only thing I\u2019m willing to come out of.' \"\nThe Daily Show with Trevor Noah\nWhen news broke of Rose's alleged sexual harassment, Colbert compared the legendary journalist to Star Wars' Yoda.\u00a0 \u201cFirst [Bill] Cosby, then Weinstein, now Charlie Rose, who\u2019s next? Yoda?\u201d Colbert said. \"Mmm, tense you seem,\" Colbert went on, imitating the Jedi master. \"Shoulders I will rub. Reported to HR I am.\" Meyers focused his \"Closer Look\" segment in part on Rose, comparing it to ABC's The Bachelor:\u00a0\u201cThis whole situation is like a reverse Bachelor. Nobody wants to accept this rose.\u201d\nColbert had Gayle King , Rose's former CBS This Morning co-host, on his show the day that Rose was fired.\u00a0The host commended King on addressing the story earlier that morning, particularly given her personal relationship with Rose. \u201cThat\u2019s what you have to do,\" King replied.\"To be honest with you, it still isn\u2019t easy. It\u2019s still very painful, it\u2019s still very hurtful. Charlie and I worked together, been friends, but when you think about the anguish of those women, despite the friendship, you still have to report the news.\"\nThe ridicule was not contained only to members of the media, however, as hosts also took down politicians and political candidates accused of sexual harassment and assault. Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore, accused by multiple women of sexual assault and misconduct when they were minors, was the subject of much ridicule. Kimmel, who sent a correspondent to one of Moore's rallies to mock his supporters, found himself called out directly by the candidate on Twitter. Moore invited Kimmel to Alabama to meet him \"man to man,\" an offer Kimmel accepted on his show, saying, \"\"I accept the invitation. I'm going to come down with a team of high school cheerleaders. \u2026 And when the girls and I show up, if you can somehow manage to keep little Roy in your cowboy pants, you and I will sit down in the food court and have a chat about Christian values.\"\nOn the other side of the political aisle, Sen. Franken was accused by multiple women of groping, unwanted kissing and sexual harassment, which included a damning photo of Franken posing in a lewd position with a sleeping Leeann Tweeden in 2006, his costar at the time in a USO show. Colbert showed the photo on his show, commenting, \"For those of you not in showbiz, actors call that technique sexual harassment.\" The CBS host also responded to Franken's statement that the photo was \"clearly intended to be funny but wasn't.\" \"Intended to be funny, but wasn\u2019t? No. You\u2019re movie Stuart Saves His Family was intended to be funny but wasn\u2019t. That photo was intended to embarrass her. That\u2019s why he did it while she was asleep. Nobody goes up to their buddy when he\u2019s awake and says \u2018Hey can I draw a penis on your forehead?\u2019 \u201d\nColbert, Conan Act as Ambassadors Abroad\nIn July, Colbert traveled to Russia for a week-long series of shows from the country at the center of much collusion talk surrounding President Trump. While there, Colbert made a guest appearance on Russian talk show Evening Urgant and took to the streets of St. Petersburg to mingle with passersby.\nColbert also\u00a0 spent time in Russia with oligarch Mikhail Prokhorov , who owns the Brooklyn Nets. \"This is how things work over in Russia,\" said Colbert, introducing his segment, \"Over there, the political system is controlled by wealthy elites who buy influence and pull strings of the government. Whereas in America, we speak English.\" The culmination of \"Russia Week\" on The Late Show came when Colbert got to tour the Moscow hotel \u00a0suite referred to in the now-infamous and debunked Russia dossier about Trump released by BuzzFeed in January. Colbert launched his full investigation of the \"pee pee tape\" on his show, where he checked in to the hotel and saw the infamous hotel room himself. \"It's soaked in history, it just washes over you,\" he joked. \"It's not even like it's in the past, you're in history.\"\nColbert wasn't the only host to travel abroad this year, as Conan O'Brien also had special remote episodes in both Mexico and Israel, where he met with locals and tried to bridge gaps between the foreign nations and America.\u00a0Conan Without Borders: Made in Mexico began\u00a0with timely jokes about Trump and his proposed border wall, including a bit with O'Brien trying to enter Mexico, but getting stopped because, as the border agents put it: \"Clearly, they're not sending us their best.\"\nO'Brien commented that in speaking to Mexican people while he visited the country, they felt misunderstood by the Trump administration, and the host clarified that Trump's view \"is a misrepresentation of how people feel,\" and doesn't represent everyone. He welcomed former Mexican president, and outspoken Trump critic, Vicente Fox to the show, who came with a gift: boots with the words \"No f\u2014ing wall.\" Fox also aimed a firm assurance to Trump: \"We're not paying for your f\u2014ing\u00a0wall!\" The TBS host reiterated to his audience that he wanted to spread positivity by his visit and use comedy as diplomacy, to cheers from the crowd and his guests.\nWhile in Israel, O'Brien met with refugees in the West Bank and traveled to the Syrian border where he visited Ziv Medical Center, a hospital where Israeli doctors are treating wounded Syrians.",

        "text": "Image\nA thorny-headed worm, usually found in pigs, preserved at the National Parasite Collection at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington. As many as one in three parasite species may face extinction because of climate change.CreditCreditPaul Fetters for the Smithsonian Institution\nSept. 13, 2017\nAnimals around the world are on the move. So are their parasites.\nRecently, scientists carried out the first large-scale study of what climate change may do to the world's much-loathed parasites. The team came to a startling conclusion: as many as one in three parasite species may face extinction in the next century.\nAs global warming raises the planet's temperature, the researchers found, many species will lose territory in which to survive. Some of their hosts will be lost, too.\n\"It still absolutely blows me away,\" said Colin J. Carlson, lead author of the study and a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley.\nHe knows many people may react to the news with a round of applause. \"Parasites are obviously a hard sell,\" Mr. Carlson said.\nBut as much as a tapeworm or a blood fluke may disgust us , parasites are crucial to the world's ecosystems. Their extinction may effect entire food webs, perhaps even harming human health.\nParasites deserve some of the respect that top predators have earned in recent decades. Wolves were once considered vermin, for example \u2014 but as they disappeared, ecosystems changed.\nScientists realized that as top predators, wolves kept populations of prey in check, which allowed plants to thrive. When wolves were restored to places like Yellowstone, local ecosystems revived , as well.\nResearchers have begun carefully studying the roles that parasites play . They make up the majority of the biomass in some ecosystems, outweighing predators sharing their environments by a factor of 20 to 1.\nFor decades, scientists who studied food webs drew lines between species \u2014 between wildebeest and the grass they grazed on, for example, and between the wildebeest and the lions that ate them.\nIn a major oversight, they didn't factor in the extent to which parasites feed on hosts. As it turns out, as much as 80 percent of the lines in a given food web are links to parasites. They are big players in the food supply.\nParasites can control populations of their hosts. Some are killed outright; other hosts, once infected, cannot reproduce, which would divert resources that the parasite craves to eggs or sperm. Some parasites move from host to host by making prey species easier for predators to kill.\nSo if these horrendous pests are major players in ecosystems that we want to save \u2014 what then? \"This view requires that parasites be protected alongside their hosts,\" said Kevin D. Lafferty, an ecologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved in the new study.\nA warming climate complicates the picture. Some researchers had already investigated the fate of a few parasite species, but Mr. Carlson and his colleagues wanted to get a global view of the impact of climate change.\nImage\nSpecimens from the National Parasite Collection, which holds more more than 20 million parasites of all varieties. Though reviled, parasites play a significant role in maintaining the world's ecosystems.CreditPaul Fetters for the Smithsonian Institution\nThey began their work with the National Parasite Collection , founded in 1892 and now maintained by the Smithsonian Institution. One of the world's biggest, it includes 20 million specimens , some preserved in jars of alcohol and some mounted on slides.\nBy determining the present range of each parasite species, Mr. Carlson and his colleagues were able to estimate the kind of climate in which it can survive and how it might fare in a hotter world.\nBuilding this global geographic database took five years. The researchers often relied on the old tags and cards stored with the specimens to figure out where they lived \u2014 often a difficult task.\n\"Sometimes you'd just get, \u2018Island, Ocean,'\" Mr. Carlson said. \"You can imagine the stress that caused.\"\nAfter he and his colleagues were done sifting through the collection, they ended up with 53,133 parasites they felt confident enough to use in their study. The records come from 457 species of tapeworms, ticks, fleas and other animals.\nParasites typically live in or on their hosts, but that does not protect them from climate change. Rising air temperatures can harm them. Ticks, for instance, risk baking in the heat as they wait in the grass for their next victim. Hookworm larvae require damp soil to survive before slipping into someone's foot.\nAnd parasites need their hosts \u2014 if they go extinct, their parasites probably will, too. So Mr. Carlson and his colleagues also evaluated how hosts are expected to fare in response to climate change.\nThe researchers combined all these factors to estimate the risk that each kind of parasite faced . Some kinds won't lose much in a warming world, the study found. For instance, thorny-headed worms are likely to be protected because their hosts, fish and birds, are common and widespread.\nBut other types, such as fleas and tapeworms, may not be able to tolerate much change in temperature; many others infect only hosts that are facing extinction, as well.\nIn all, roughly 30 percent of parasitic species could disappear, Mr. Carlson concluded. The impact of climate change will be as great or greater for these species as for any others studied so far.\nDr. Lafferty said the new results challenged those of much smaller studies, which had come to opposite conclusions. \"Our natural tendency is to assume that parasites and the disease they cause will increase as the rest of biodiversity declines,\" he said.\nMr. Carlson said that climate change would do more than just drive some species extinct. Some parasites would move into new territory.\nDeer ticks, for example, spread Lyme disease, and climate change models suggest they have a rosy future as they expand northward. \"We're not worried about them going extinct,\" said Mr. Carlson.\nMigrating parasites like these will arrive in ecosystems where other parasitic species are disappearing. With less competition, they may be able to wreak more havoc \u2014 and not just on animal hosts. Many human diseases are the result of parasites and pathogens jumping from animal species to our own.\n\"If parasites are keeping disease down in wildlife, they might also be indirectly keeping them down in humans,\" Mr. Carlson said. \"And we might lose that.\"\nFollow Carl Zimmer on Twitter @carlzimmer",

According to the commander of the special forces, all the staff who were inside the building have been rescued,\u201d Shamshad TV announced as it went back on the air.\nA Shamshad news presenter, his hands bandaged after cutting himself on glass as he fled the attackers, told viewers that 20 colleagues had been wounded. Six were in a critical condition.\n\u201cWe have all come back [to work], all our journalists and colleagues are back on duty,\u201d he said.\nThe news director of Shamshad, Abid Ehsas, interviewed by rival Tolo News at a hospital in the Afghan capital where some of his wounded colleagues were being treated, said: \u201cThis is an attack on freedom of media, but they cannot silence us.\u201d\nThe station reported that one attacker blew himself up at the gate. Another went inside and shot at staff before going up to the roof to fire at security forces.\nSpecial forces had to blast their way through a wall of the compound to enter the premises of the Pashto-language broadcaster.\n\u201cI was in my office when gunmen wearing police uniforms attacked the building,\u201d Ehsas said. \u201cThey killed one of our guards and entered the building and started firing. Most of us were able to flee but some were wounded and some jumped out of the windows.\u201d\nHe said the station had not received any threats before the attack.\nGunshots could be heard inside the building every few minutes during the assault as security forces and emergency services swarmed the area.\nAn employee told AFP he had seen three attackers entering the building on security cameras. \u201cThey first shot the guard and then entered the building. They started throwing grenades and firing,\u201d Shamshad TV reporter Faisal Zaland, who escaped through a back door, told AFP.\nInterior ministry spokesman Najib Danish said one employee had been killed and 24 people wounded, including four firefighters.\nIn a tweet, the Afghan Journalists Safety Committee (AJSC) renewed its call for \u201cthe government to take all preventive measures to protect\u201d the media \u2013 sentiments echoed by Amnesty International.\nPresident Ashraf Ghani pledged to take \u201cserious measures\u201d to protect journalists in a statement condemning the attack.\nIsis claimed responsibility for the assault in a statement released by its Amaq propaganda agency. The Taliban had earlier released a Twitter statement denying involvement.\nPashto is one of the official languages in Afghanistan and is spoken mainly in the south, where the Taliban have a large presence.\nThe attack spotlighted the increasing dangers faced by media workers in Afghanistan as security worsens. The country suffered its deadliest year on record for journalists in 2016, according to the AJSC, with at least 13 media workers killed. That made it the second most dangerous place for reporters in the world after Syria.\nSecurity in Kabul has been ramped up since 31 May, when a truck bomb went off on the edge of the \u201cGreen Zone\u201d. About 150 people were killed and 400 others were wounded.\nSpecial truck scanners, barriers and permanent and mobile checkpoints have been rolled out across the city.\nThe last major assault in Kabul was on 21 October when a suicide attacker hit a bus carrying Afghan army trainees, killing 15 people.\nA day earlier, a suicide bomber pretending to be a worshipper blew himself up inside a Shia mosque in the city during evening prayers, killing 56 and wounding 55.\nThis month, Kabul police stopped a lorry carrying 2,700kg of explosives hidden under boxes of tomatoes, averting a potentially deadly blast.",

        "text": "Dear Donald Trump,\nLast Friday, audio leaked of you making incredibly demeaning comments about women and bragging about sexual assault. When asked to justify your statements, you claimed that this was \"locker room talk,\" and it's just how guys speak about women.\nYou're wrong, and only the type of wrong an over-tanned ham hock like yourself can accomplish, plummeting past the morass of gross incivility into the abyss of depraved sociopathy.\nHow do I know this? Simple. I was in an NFL locker room for eight years, the very definition of the macho, alpha male environment you're so feebly trying to evoke to protect yourself, and not once did anyone approach your breathtaking depths of arrogant imbecility. Oh, sure, we had some dumb guys, and some guys I wouldn't want to hang out with on any sort of regular basis, but we never had anyone say anything as foul and demeaning as you did on that tape, and, hell, I played a couple years with a guy who later turned out to be a serial rapist. Even he never talked like that.\nNow, Donald, I'm sure you're wondering just what it is we talk about in a professional locker room, if we don't spend all our time regarding 50 percent of the population as mobile fuck receptacles eagerly awaiting our tiny-handed grasp on their love lapels. I shall educate you!\nWe talk about our families. We talk about our significant others, our children, and our parents. We talk about our fears that if a Hitler wannabe who can't even string together a coherent statement on domestic policy becomes president, what that might mean for those of us who are married to a member of a minority community, or are a member of a minority community, or have children going to schools where hopefully nobody screams racial epithets at them or tells them to go back to [insert foreign country they couldn't identify on a map here].\nWe talk about travel. We talk about the cities we've seen, the stadiums we've played in, what vacations we might take in the offseason. We talk about what country might make a good safe haven if a Russian-backed presidential candidate whose foreign policy agenda can best be described as \"gross negligence mixed with a spicy dash of treason\" were to have control of our nation's nuclear arsenal, and whether his stubby little baby fingers are strong enough to push in the launch codes on sturdy military-grade hardware.\nWe talk about money. We talk about what other guys at our position are making, what our next contract might look like, and how much paying taxes each year sucks, since we're in the highest tax bracket and play in multiple states, requiring multiple filings. We talk about how all of us pay taxes, every year, and wonder what a presidential candidate might have to hide if he so stubbornly refuses to release his returns, what possible foreign debts might be lurking in that finance closet he so desperately holds shut with every ounce of his contemptible mental faculties.\nWe talk about women (and sex!). We talk about wives, sisters, mothers, daughters, fans, and groupies. Most guys respect women, some guys don't, but never have I heard anyone use your particularly disgusting brand of sadism that refers to women as objects and not people. Even the most debauched club-hopping party animal talks about women more civilly than you. We don't let each other talk like that about women, because it lessens our humanity, and even though we're modern-day gladiators, we still hold ourselves accountable to the idea of basic human decency.\nWe talk about jokes. Clean jokes, dirty jokes, jokes that are in between. Hell, I made a joke about Penn State that got me in trouble years later, because someone thought I was attacking the victims instead of the institution that allowed such depravity to happen. You know what I did? I apologized. I said I was sorry. I didn't apologize with \"if your feelings were hurt by it\"; I didn't try to deflect it by attacking someone else, or their spouse; I didn't lie to an entire nation on live TV and say, \"Nope, that never happened.\" I simply said, \"I'm sorry, I made a mistake, I'm accountable, I'll do better next time.\"\nSee, that's another big thing we talk about in the locker room. Accountability. In a professional sports environment, all of us are accountable to each other. We're a team. If one of us messes up on the field, it affects everyone. Just like if a president makes a bad decision, it affects everyone. And do you know, Donald, the only way the team wins games? The only way we win is if, in the locker room, we're willing to accept that accountability, address our mistakes, and work as hard as we possibly can to make sure those mistakes don't happen again.\nWe don't double down on a shitty play simply because a small portion of the fan base got excited by it. We don't try to carve the team apart from the inside to appease a certain position group. We don't blame our mistakes on something someone else did, because if we do any of those things, we lose, something you've become intimately familiar with on a personal, financial, and political level, and I'm not having too many difficulties reviewing how that happened to you on the game film.\nSo let me conclude with some advice for you, Donald. The next time you want to claim that something is \"locker room talk,\" take a moment to recognize the fact that were you in an actual locker room, you would be universally reviled as a cancerous, egotistical train wreck of a disgrace that no team could possibly find the time to employ and, honestly, would never even have on their draft board to begin with.\nI've been in locker rooms, Donald, and you're the type of narcissistic, pants-soiling fecal eruption that just doesn't belong. Even football players are smart enough to know that.\nSincerely,\nChris Kluwe\nFormer NFL player, proud father of two daughters I\u2019m afraid you would eagerly deport and/or molest, American citizen\nChris Kluwe played eight years in the NFL for the Minnesota Vikings, is the author of the book Beautifully Unique Sparkleponies and co-author of the sci-fi book Prime: A Genesis Series Event, and can be found on twitter @ChrisWarcraft, where he's usually causing some sort of ruckus.

        "text": "More than a quarter of the firearms seized on the streets here by the Chicago Police Department over the past five years were bought just outside city limits in Cook County suburbs, according to an analysis by the University of Chicago Crime Lab. Others came from stores around Illinois and from other states, like Indiana , less than an hour\u2019s drive away. Since 2008, more than 1,300 of the confiscated guns, the analysis showed, were bought from just one store, Chuck\u2019s Gun Shop in Riverdale, Ill., within a few miles of Chicago\u2019s city limits.\nEfforts to compare the strictness of gun laws and the level of violence across major American cities are fraught with contradiction and complication, not least because of varying degrees of coordination between local and state laws and differing levels of enforcement. In New York City, where homicides and shootings have decreased, the gun laws are generally seen as at least as strict as Chicago\u2019s, and the state laws in New York and many of its neighboring states are viewed as still tougher than those in and around Illinois. Philadelphia , like cities in many states, is limited in writing gun measures that go beyond those set by Pennsylvania law. Some city officials there have chafed under what they see as relatively lax state controls.\nIn Chicago, the rules for owning a handgun \u2014 rewritten after the outright ban was deemed too restrictive in 2010 \u2014 sound arduous. Owners must seek a Chicago firearms permit, which requires firearms training, a background check and a state-mandated firearm owner\u2019s identification card, which requires a different background review for felonies and mental illness. To prevent straw buyers from selling or giving their weapons to people who would not meet the restrictions \u2014 girlfriends buying guns for gang members is a common problem, the police here say \u2014 the city requires permitted gun owners to report their weapons lost, sold or stolen.\nPhoto\nStill, for all the regulations, the reality here looks different. Some 7,640 people currently hold a firearms permit, but nearly that many illicit weapons were confiscated from the city\u2019s streets during last year alone. Chicago officials say Illinois has no requirement, comparable to Chicago\u2019s, that gun owners immediately report their lost or stolen weapons to deter straw buyers. Consequently those outside the city can, in the words of one city official, carry guns to gang members in the city with \u201czero accountability.\u201d\nAnd a relatively common sentence in state court for gun possession for offenders without other felonies is one year in prison, which really may mean a penalty of six months, said Anita Alvarez, the Cook County state\u2019s attorney, who said such punishments failed to serve as a significant enough deterrent for seasoned criminals who may see a modest prison stint as the price of doing business.\n\u201cThe way the laws are structured facilitates the flow of those guns to hit our streets,\u201d Garry F. McCarthy, the Chicago police superintendent, said in an interview, later adding, \u201cChicago may have comprehensive gun laws, but they are not strict because the sanctions don\u2019t exist.\u201d\nIn the weeks since the mass shooting in Newtown , Conn., Toni Preckwinkle, the Cook County Board president, has introduced a countywide provision requiring gun owners beyond the city limits to report lost or stolen guns, though a first offense would result simply in a $1,000 fine. In the city, Mayor Rahm Emanuel has pressed for increased penalties for those who violate the city\u2019s gun ordinance by failing to report their guns missing or possessing an assault weapon.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\u201cOur gun strategy is only as strong as it is comprehensive, and it is constantly being undermined by events and occurrences happening outside the city \u2014 gun shows in surrounding counties, weak gun laws in neighboring states like Indiana and the inability to track purchasing,\u201d Mr. Emanuel said. \u201cThis must change.\u201d\nPhoto\nState lawmakers, too, are soon expected to weigh new state provisions like an assault weapons ban, as Chicago already has. But the fate of the proposals is uncertain in a state with wide-open farming and hunting territory downstate.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a fight,\u201d said State Representative Jack D. Franks, a Democrat from Marengo, 60 miles outside Chicago. Complicating matters, an appellate court in December struck down the state\u2019s ban on carrying guns in public, saying that a complete ban on concealed carry is unconstitutional. Illinois is seeking a review of the ruling, even as state lawmakers have been given a matter of months to contemplate conditions under which guns could be allowed in public.\nMany here say that even the strictest, most punitive gun laws would not alone be an answer to this city\u2019s violence. \u201cPoverty, race, guns and drugs \u2014 you\u2019ve got to deal with all these issues, but you\u2019ve got to start somewhere\u201d said the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson , who was arrested in 2007 while protesting outside Chuck\u2019s Gun Shop, the suburban store long known as a supplier of weapons that make their way to Chicago.\nAt the store, a clerk said the business followed all pertinent federal, state and local laws, then declined to be interviewed further. Among seized guns that had moved from purchase to the streets of Chicago in a year\u2019s time or less, nearly 20 percent came from Chuck\u2019s, the analysis found. Other guns arrived here that rapidly from gun shops in other parts of this state, Indiana, Wisconsin , Kentucky , Mississippi , Georgia , Iowa and more.\n\u201cChicago is not an island,\u201d said David Spielfogel, senior adviser to Mr. Emanuel. \u201cWe\u2019re only as strong as the weakest gun law in surrounding states.\u201d",

Without it, recess could leave the nine-year-old gasping for breath. He gets a second dose at the end of the day before heading home from St John Bosco Elementary School, in San Antonio, Texas.\nHow big oil is tightening its grip on Donald Trump's White House Read more\nOver the past year, Gabriel\u2019s asthma has worsened. Visits to the emergency room, shortened trips to the park and reliance on inhalers have become his new norm. \u201cIt got to the point where I couldn\u2019t even leave him with anybody,\u201d said his father, Gabe, who works as a consultant to the National Association of Public Employees, a workers\u2019 advocacy group, and a seasonal field director of the Bexar County Democratic Party. \u201cOne time he almost looked blue.\u201d\nGabriel\u2019s health is deteriorating alongside air quality in San Antonio, where oil and gas development, a hotter climate and a growing population have combined to spell misery for a city that once boasted clean air compared to other Texas metropolitan areas. Part of the problem lies southeast of the city in the Eagle Ford Shale,a 400-mile-long hub of hydraulic fracturing that unleashes microscopic particles and smog-causing, ground-level ozone.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gabe Rosales and his son, Gabriel. Photograph: Tom Dart for the Guardian\nThe state\u2019s environmental regulator \u2013 the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality \u2013 has been criticized for not making things better. In fact, it\u2019s followed in the footsteps of Big Oil\u2019s biggest lobby, the American Petroleum Institute, which has forestalled progress on ozone for decades. Using consultants also hired by API, the commission has spent millions of taxpayer dollars in an effort to question scientific evidence linking particulate matter and ozone with bronchitis, asthma and premature death.\nAir quality is the new frontier for climate-change skeptics long tied to API. The institute has fueled uncertainty on climate by producing what critics call misleading scientific and economic studies. Now, by attempting to discredit established research on ozone and fine particles, API and its cadre of doubters are trying to undermine the Clean Air Act \u2013 the landmark US law credited with saving millions of lives. Working in concert with other free-market groups, they\u2019re taking their message to Capitol Hill. API officials did not grant interview requests from the Center for Public Integrity.\nTimeline Big oil and the US government Show Hide\nStandard Oil broken up Standard Oil\u2019s monopoly is broken up by the US supreme court. The trust which had been set up by John D Rockefeller in 1882, had gained control of nearly 90% of US oil production. Oil industry gets close to government during war The US joins the first world war and supplies allied forces with oil. President Woodrow Wilson appoints multiple oil executives to war-effort committees and nationalises the railways. API created Brought together by the war, oil executives form a trade body, the American Petroleum Institute (API) in 1919. Ten years later, another trade association, the Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA) is formed to represent smaller companies. Second world war starts During the second world war, the US government worked closely with the oil industry, putting a federal investigation into its monopolistic practices on hold. A peacetime version of a wartime committee becomes the National Petroleum Council, an advisory committee that exists today.\nGlobal warming warning API hosts renowned nuclear physicist Edward Teller at a conference at Columbia University, where he warns of impending global warming. President Johnson warns of global warning Lyndon B Johnson is the first US president to publicly acknowledge climate change, calling it a serious global threat during a speech. CO2 warning Scientists at the Stanford Research Institute deliver reports to API, warning of global warming induced by CO2 emissions from fossil fuels. EPA created President Nixon signs an executive order creating the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). CO2 research by Exxon starts Exxon starts an internal climate research programme on carbon dioxide. Ozone standards weakened The EPA relaxes the standard for ozone, which contributes to smog. The move angers environmentalists and industry alike. API sues the agency. Nasa scientist gives evidence Nasa scientist James E Hansen testifies before Congress that the planet is warming because of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from fossil fuels. Kyoto Protocol signed The Kyoto protocol treaty is signed. Countries pledge to reduce greenhouse gases and recognise the scientific consensus that global warming is occurring and is likely caused by fossil fuel emissions. Paris accord signed Some 195 countries back the Paris climate agreement, pledging efforts to reduce emissions and curb global warming. Trump announces US exit from Paris President Trump announces the US exit from the Paris climate agreement, citing industry-hired economists that call the accord a bad deal for US businesses. Supporting the move is Scott Pruitt, a climate-change sceptic, who Trump appointed to head the EPA.\nResidents of San Antonio\u2019s low-income, mostly Latino neighborhoods \u2013 like Hillcrest, where Gabriel Rosales lives \u2013 bear the brunt of poor air quality even if they aren\u2019t in ozone hot spots, said Mario Bravo, an outreach specialist with the Environmental Defense Fund. \u201cThey have less access to healthcare,\u201d Bravo said. \u201cThey have less access to transportation to get to the health-care providers.\u201d\nDangerous and under dispute\nIn June, two peer-reviewed studies trumpeted a conclusion at odds with years of solid science: fine-particle pollution long linked to premature death and chronic illness isn\u2019t as dangerous as health advocates contend. If true, the findings would call into question health benefits claimed by the US Environmental Protection Agency, which has set ever-tightening air-quality standards.\nThere was a catch, however. The articles \u2013 which were published within a week of one another \u2013 appeared in Critical Reviews in Toxicology and Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology, two journals favored by industry consultants. And both studies were funded by API, a trade group that has spent $40m since 2013 to lobby Congress on topics ranging from taxes to global warming.\n\u201cOur study is published ... air quality does not kill. $600m of EPA junk science up in smoke,\u201d Steve Milloy, a climate change skeptic and Donald Trump acolyte, tweeted in June, linking to the Regulatory Toxicology article. During a congressional luncheon a month later, the former coal executive took credit for conceiving the study before turning it over to friend, S Stanley Young, and two other statisticians, who authored the final article. No mention of Milloy\u2019s involvement is made in the publication.\nSome of the same data was used in the Critical Reviews article published by Louis Anthony \u201cTony\u201d Cox Jr, which also disputed the link between fine particles and mortality. Cox, a biostatistician from Colorado, started consulting for API in 1988. Cox disclosed that his paper \u201cbenefited from close proofreading and copy editing suggestions from API\u201d but denied in an interview that his findings were influenced. In November, he was named the next chair of the EPA\u2019s Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, drawing criticism from groups like the Union of Concerned Scientists.\nThe science on particle pollution, much like the science on global warming, is exhaustive and widely accepted, with thousands of studies pointing to serious health implications. The World Health Organization notes that particulate matter \u201caffects more people than any other pollutant\u201d, with effects observed at even \u201cvery low concentrations\u201d. The particles \u2013 found in automotive and industrial exhaust and smaller than one-fifth of the width of a strand of hair \u2013 form a toxic mix with ozone that lodges deep in the lungs. Unlike Cox, most researchers are no longer fixated on whether this form of pollution is fundamentally dangerous; they worry instead about whether it can cause \u2013 not just exacerbate \u2013 chronic illness.\nAttacking the science is one way of undermining the Clean Air Act, said John Walke of the Natural Resources Defense Council, which advocates for more protective air-quality standards. The Clean Air Act is routinely hailed as one of the most cost-effective federal laws, even by business groups. In 2015, the EPA estimated that the law will have saved the US economy $2tn by 2020 while costing $65bn to implement. About 85% of the act\u2019s benefits come from reducing fine-particle pollution, which raises the risk of early death. Opponents of the law \u201cdeny that air pollution is deadly \u2026 or even harmful in order to try to pretend that no benefits are delivered,\u201d Walke said.\nMilloy\u2019s July congressional luncheon at the Rayburn House Office Building \u2013 billed as a \u201ccongressional staff and media briefing\u201d \u2013 helped him plug his latest book, Scare Pollution: Why and How to Fix the EPA, which condemns the \u201cecho chamber of deceptive science\u201d on ozone and fine particles. Copies of the book were on a table at the side of the room.\nThe event was hosted by Myron Ebell, who chairs the Cooler Heads Coalition, a climate skeptics\u2019 group that began as an alliance of free-market think tanks. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot like climate,\u201d Milloy told the audience. \u201cThis stuff is pulled out of thin air.\u201d\nReached for comment, Milloy said the study is not an attack on the Clean Air Act but part of his 20-year effort to expose the EPA\u2019s \u201cgarbage-in, garbage-out\u201d air pollution research. He denied having any formal ties to API. \u201cI am very, very disappointed in the American Petroleum Institute and all the oil companies for not defending their products, for leaving the science to people like me,\u201d he said.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Steve Milloy Illustration: Robert G Fresson\nYoung, who authored the study, stood behind its findings and disputed the idea that industry funding presents ethical conflicts. His study data are publicly available, he said, but the EPA isn\u2019t as transparent. Ebell agreed, accusing the agency of using \u201cjunk science\u201d to justify air-quality and greenhouse-gas regulation.\nDespite their misgivings about the EPA, all three men have become tethered to the agency. Earlier this year, Ebell oversaw the EPA transition for Trump, leading a group that included Milloy. Young was named to the EPA\u2019s Science Advisory Board in October.\nSenator Sheldon Whitehouse, co-founder of the Senate Climate Action Task Force, complained that such appointments have become all too common. \u201cThese people were fringe fanatics and industry stooges fighting on behalf of the industry a propaganda war against science,\u201d he said.\nMilloy and Ebell were listed among the authors of a $2m plan to amplify uncertainty in climate science \u2013 as revealed in a 1998 API memo leaked to The New York Times. Both say the memo grew out of an API brainstorming session that never resulted in concrete action, with Milloy calling it \u201cjust a big joke\u201d.\nYears before, API had refuted the very concept of global warming under its president, Charles DiBona, who joined the institute shortly after a stint as energy policy advisor to Richard Nixon in the 1970s. White House communications show that DiBona regularly met with then president Frank Ikard, a close friend of Nixon\u2019s, before becoming Ikard\u2019s deputy in 1974.\nIn recent years, fringe views espoused by API have found a receptive audience in US Representative Lamar Smith, whose climate-denial credentials rival those of Republican Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma. Since Smith became chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology in 2013, the panel has handed out dozens of subpoenas \u2013 many to scientists at regulatory agencies and environmental groups \u2013 aiming to debunk climate research.\nSmith \u2013 whose district includes San Antonio \u2013 has opened the committee\u2019s hearing rooms to Cooler Heads Coalition events such as Milloy\u2019s book promotion and briefings that urged the United States to drop out of the 2015 Paris climate agreement. In February, he reissued a controversial subpoena to New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman, who is investigating ExxonMobil\u2019s historical knowledge on climate change. Since he joined Congress in 1989, Smith\u2019s top campaign donors have been from the oil and gas sector, which gave him at least $764,000, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Smith did not respond to requests for comment.\nIn 2016, Influence Map, a nonprofit environmental research group, estimated that ExxonMobil had spent about $27m on \u201cclimate obstruction\u201d lobbying and advertising campaigns. That amount was dwarfed by the $65m API spent on similar efforts, the group found. ExxonMobil is one of the oldest and largest API members.\n\u2018Tired, old industry argument\u2019\nIn July, the House passed a bill targeting what its proponents called \u201cjob-killing regulations\u201d \u2013 namely, bedrock air-quality standards. Its lead author was Representative Pete Olson, a Republican from the ozone-plagued Houston area. All but four of the 229 \u201caye\u201d votes were cast by Republicans, Lamar Smith among them.\nUnder Olson\u2019s bill, states would have until 2025 to meet the EPA\u2019s latest ozone limit, which was supposed to take effect in October. The agency, which is legally required to update air standards to keep pace with evolving science, would be obligated to review rules for pollutants once a decade, as opposed to once every five years.\nThe 2017 bill is the latest iteration of a proposal Olson first floated in 2015, seeking to delay regulation of ozone. The same day his bill passed, 144 trade groups, including regional offshoots of API, pledged their support in a letter to Congress. Oil and gas interests have been Olson\u2019s top political contributors, donating more than $1m to his campaigns since 2007. A Senate version of the bill has not come up for a vote.\nIn an email, Olson\u2019s office wrote that the congressman \u201cbelieves the Clean Air Act is critically important\u201d but has \u201cfundamental concerns\u201d about Texas\u2019 ability to meet tighter standards. Pollution control, the email said, \u201ccan be done rationally and with an eye on our economy\u201d.\nBy law, the EPA is not allowed to consider cost when setting ozone standards, but that hasn\u2019t stopped API and other industry groups from injecting economics into the policy debate.\nEconomics, like some controversial science, has provided API with grist to challenge regulations.\nArmed with seemingly authoritative studies from firms such as NERA Economic Consulting, the institute has recast issues such as action on climate change as reckless moves that could tank the US economy. NERA, whose clients include API collaborators such as the National Association of Manufacturers and the American Chemistry Council, was co-founded by Irwin Stelzer, an economist who works at the Hudson Institute, a free-market think tank.\nSuch studies, like the NERA report Trump cited when he announced the US exit from the Paris climate agreement earlier this year, can be \u201cextremely misleading\u201d, often tallying every conceivable cost and ignoring every possible benefit, said Ben Franta, a Stanford University researcher investigating API\u2019s climate activities. Because data underlying these reports are proprietary, Franta said, in many cases they can neither be verified or debunked. What\u2019s left are unsupported arguments: \u201cNew ozone rules could be the most expensive ever,\u201d reads an API webpage linking to dozens of NERA findings.\nThe Texas Commission on Environmental Quality has taken a tack similar to API\u2019s. Since 2013, the TCEQ has paid NERA more than $870,000 for economic research on ozone \u2013 a topic the firm studied earlier for API. More than $2.2m in taxpayer funds have also been spent on contracts with Gradient \u2013 a consultancy previously hired by API to question the benefits of a stricter ozone limit. The TCEQ declined to comment on this story but on its website describes its mission as protecting the \u201cstate\u2019s public health and natural resources consistent with sustainable economic development\u201d.\nAnne E Smith, a managing director at NERA, did not respond to emails and phone calls seeking comment. She was among several industry-friendly voices at a 2015 TCEQ ozone workshop in Austin led by Michael Honeycutt, the agency\u2019s director of toxicology. Other speakers included Gradient scientists, the editor of Critical Reviews in Toxicology, industry toxicologist Michael Dourson and air researcher Robert Phalen, known for saying the air \u201cis a little too clean for optimum health\u201d.\nSpeakers at the Austin workshop have risen to prominence in the Trump administration. This fall, Honeycutt, Anne Smith, Dourson and Phalen were all named to key EPA science positions as either advisers or staff.\nEconomics has long figured into API\u2019s strategy to derail ozone rules. In 1971, the newly formed EPA set the ozone standard at 80 parts per billion, but in 1979 took an unexpected U-turn and weakened it to 120 ppb \u2013 angering industry and environmentalists alike. The latter called the reversal scientifically indefensible and accused the EPA of prioritizing economics over health. API promptly sued the EPA, with DiBona claiming the relaxed standards would still cost \u201cbillions of dollars without significantly improving the quality of the environment or the health of the public\u201d.\nSpurred by lawsuits from the American Lung Association that compelled it to update air standards based on the latest science, the EPA reverted to its original 80 ppb ozone limit in 1997. The cap is now at 70 ppb, though even that number may not be protective enough, as some research has found health effects at 60 ppb.\nNonetheless, EPA administrator Scott Pruitt \u2013 a former Oklahoma attorney general with deep ties to oil and gas \u2013 tried to keep the 70 ppb standard from taking effect. He backed off on the delay after 16 state attorneys general sued the agency in August. In a lawsuit filed this month, however, environmental groups accused the EPA of failing to enforce the rule.\nPruitt had put forth what Dr Greg Diette \u2013 a lung specialist at Johns Hopkins University who has testified in favor of tighter ozone standards \u2013 calls \u201ca tired, old industry argument. They say, \u2018It\u2019s going to put us out of business,\u2019 and it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Diette said. \u201cAll this stuff always comes down to who has to pay.\u201d\nBut not all costs are economic. High ozone days are the hardest for Diette\u2019s patients. \u201cIt can be terrifying \u2013 it\u2019s the sensation of not being able to breathe,\u201d he said. \u201cSome feel as if they\u2019re going to pass out. Some feel as if they\u2019re going to die.\u201d\nAsthmatics can do little more than hide indoors in an air-conditioned environment. The only other option, Diette said, is to move.\nRelocating isn\u2019t possible for the Rosales family of San Antonio, who are uninsured and struggling to keep up with the cost of Gabriel\u2019s medications. The air he breathes is expected to degrade further as oil prices rebound and drilling picks up in the Eagle Ford.\nWith additional reporting by Tom Dart in San Antonio, Texas.\nRead the final part of the Guardian US/Center for Public Integrity pieces on big oil and power on Sunday: Venue of last resort: the climate lawsuits threatening future of Big Oil.\nRead more in the Center for Public Integrity\u2019s special report, Unites States of Petroleum.",

They had me at: \u201cOne does not offer prayers in lieu of demonstrating political courage, but rather in preparation.\u201d\nRead their powerful words here ... and then let us find the courage and resolve to both pray and act to end the scourge of gun violence in our nation.\nCall for the Church to Pray, Elected Officials to Act\nIn the wake of the heartbreaking shooting at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, we find ourselves both calling people to prayer, and wishing that the word did not come so readily to the lips of elected leaders who are quick to speak, but take no action on behalf of public safety.\nIn prayer, Christians commend the souls of the faithful departed to the mercy and love of God. We beseech our Creator to comfort the grieving and shield the vulnerable. Prayer is not an offering of vague good wishes. It is not a spiritual exercise that successfully completed exempts one from focusing on urgent issues of common concern. Prayer is not a dodge. In prayer we examine our own hearts and our own deeds to determine whether we are complicit in the evils we deplore. And if we are, we resolve to take action; we resolve to amend our lives.\nAs a nation, we must acknowledge that we idolize violence, and we must make amends. Violence of all kinds denigrates humankind; it stands against the will of God and the way of Jesus the Christ. The shooting in Sutherland Springs brings the issue of domestic violence, a common thread in many mass killings, into sharp relief. It is not only essential that we keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, but that we, as a society, reject ideologies of male dominance that permeate our culture and the history of our churches.\nEach of us has a role to play in our repentance. Elected representatives bear the responsibility of passing legislation that protects our citizenry. If our representatives are not up to this responsibility, we must replace them.\nIn the meantime, however, we ask that in honor of our many murdered dead, elected leaders who behave as though successive episode of mass slaughter are simply the price our nation pays for freedom stop the reflexive and corrosive repetition of the phrase \u201cthoughts and prayers.\u201d",

The grant period begins March 1 of this year and runs through March 1, 2020, and is renewable.\nFunding was previously allocated for the position by the Project Impact Advisory Board during a Jan. 11 meeting, said Victoria Fulton, program manager for Project Impact.\n\u201cThe early learning evaluation specialist will create and maintain longitudinal databases on the early grades that will enhance our ability to assess and validate the relationship between early learning interventions and success in the third grade and beyond,\u201d she said.\nThe specialist will work with the district\u2019s Office of Early Learning, Instructional Services and Research and Evaluation, as well as Project Impact, according to the job description.\nAs part of this position, the district is asked to give updates and reports on the progress of the program, as well as results in March 2020.\nBoard Member David Singletary said during the meeting that having someone fill this position will help the board and district in being able to go through research and statistics to show the growth of pre-K students as they progress to higher grades.\n\u201cI believe that there is something there that we are missing, and I believe this will help us to identify and correct,\u201d he said.\nSuperintendent Beverly Emory said afterward that having the early learning evaluation specialist will be beneficial to the district.\n\u201cHaving that dedicated person I think will help us move the needle, what\u2019s working, what isn\u2019t working,\u201d she said.\nEmory added that it will be helpful to have research that shows the progress and effects of early learning initiatives here in the district.\n\u201cI think it is one thing to talk about the research out of Baltimore, it\u2019s another to say our kids, right?\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really what we\u2019re trying to get at, is show that connection between our own programming and our kids\u2019 outcomes.\u201d\nTuesday\u2019s Board of Education meeting was held at Kernersville Elementary School, rather than the usual meeting space at the WS/FCS Education Building.

        "text": "Iowa\u2019s Republican-led government made it a priority earlier this year to limit the ability of unionized public sector workers in the state to collectively bargain. But these lawmakers are learning that hardworking public servants aren\u2019t backing down from this fight.\nAfter a new law was enacted in February, workers this month were forced to revote on whether to remain in their union. The odds were stacked up against organized labor. A majority of workers in each unit needed to vote \u201cyes\u201d \u2013 non-voters would be counted as a \u201cno\u201d vote due to the ridiculously undemocratic supermajority rules in place. But late last month, Teamsters made it clear that they are proud to be members of the union family!\nTeamsters Local 238 ran 69 state-sponsored recertification elections for 2,200 bargaining unit members this month. Of the 1,888 members who voted, 1,828 voted to remain with the Teamsters. You read that right \u2013 97 percent of them voted yes! In the end, 57 Teamster units decided to remain with the union. As a result, only 44 dues-paying members were included in units that didn\u2019t achieve the required supermajority.\nOther unions were also successful in their efforts. The Iowa Public Employment Relations Board reported that 436 out of 468 public-sector bargaining units statewide voted to remain union affiliated. Some 88 percent of members participated in the votes. In the end, this entire effort approved by Iowa\u2019s GOP leadership was nothing more than a colossal waste of taxpayer dollars spent to tally up these election results and will continue to be so.\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 this union is not happy to lose any of its members. But given the roadblocks constructed by anti-union elected officials in the state, the results are overwhelmingly positive. Teamster members and staff who worked for months to build solidarity and momentum across the board should be proud of their efforts.\nSo how did such a successful campaign happen? One word \u2013 organizing.\nThe law that led to these recertification votes was an attack on working families, and hardworking Iowans knew it. Imagine if these annual recertification rules applied to elected officials? No one would reach the threshold and get elected!\nIowa Teamsters, whose members include many working in law enforcement, were active in the effort to defeat this legislation. Despite the inclusion of language that would have exempted public safety employees from certain provisions of the legislation, the union refused to back down in its opposition to a measure that would affect more than 180,000 public service workers.\nThe Teamsters stood up against these anti-union actions because they understood what was at stake. Voting yes was the first step in fighting back against a larger attack on working families in Iowa. Teamster members realized the attack on bargaining rights was part of an overall agenda that includes cuts in community colleges and universities, nursing home inspections, workers compensation benefits, veterans home ownership assistance and funding for child abuse investigations.\nHardworking Iowans knew the jobs they did were essential to keep their cities and towns running, and voted yes to keep their unions strong. They understood that supporting their union would ensure workers would have a voice on the job, protect their rights and allow them to bargain for their benefits. Voting yes would allow workers and their families to maintain their dignity.\nWorkers in Iowa are tuning in more than ever to the reality that big corporate interests have a legislative agenda that hurts working families. But Teamster members are ready to fight back, organizing their workplaces and are ready for any future battles.",

Broome is asking the council to take that money from excess sales tax collections.\nThe mayor issued an executive order last November to change the \u201cculture\u201d of city-parish contracting in an effort to increase the amount of work going to disadvantaged business enterprises\u2014 defined by the federal government as firms with majority ownership by socially and economically disadvantaged groups. She had vowed to tackle the issue on the campaign trail and one of her transition team committees concluded that too few minority-owned firms participated in city-parish contracting.\nAsked why the additional language was added, Broome, who is in Washington, D.C. this week, says in a statement that she\u2019s had requests to add a small-medium business component to the study, and she\u2019s obliged. She adds that the intent of the study is to make sure all groups have access to public work.\nThe study was deferred this week at the council meeting, which only had eight members present for parts of the meeting.\n\u201cOnce we are certain that everyone feels represented in the study, we will bring it to a vote,\u201d Broome says.\nCouncilman Buddy Amoroso says he has worked with the mayor\u2019s administration since the executive order first came out to try to add a small- and medium-sized business component, adding he couldn\u2019t have voted for it otherwise.\nTypically, smaller businesses are local businesses, Amoroso says. Adding the language is a good way to make sure local firms have a shot at city-parish contracts.\n\u201cThe thing about it is this does not set up a quota system,\u201d Amoroso says. \u201cThis basically establishes a goal the city has that so much of the business would be given to small businesses, medium-sized businesses, DBEs and veteran-owned enterprises.\u201d",

In fact, I\u2019ve stopped writing to-do lists altogether and find my workday is actually better off. Here are a few hidden reasons why your to-do list\u2013no matter how you write it\u2013might be holding you back.\nadvertisement\nRelated: Why Creating A To-Do List Is Derailing Your Success\n1. It Dampens Your Mood The First Thing In The Morning\nConfronting\u00a0your to-do list as soon as you sit down at your desk is frequently depressing. And while it\u2019s true that banking small wins (i.e. crossing items off your to-do list) can be motivating , you may just be recovering the momentum you lost in the act of mapping out your daily tasks. Let me explain.\nI have several things I need to do today. Completing this Fast Company article is one of them. As always, I\u2019m excited about submitting a new piece and know I need to look it over and make final tweaks before doing so. Right now, this article is mostly in my head\u2013where it belongs. If it were to become an item on a sheet notepad or in a to-do app, it would lose its imaginative power, which is precisely the thing that makes me excited to accomplish it.\nSome activities\u00a0benefit from not\u00a0being reduced to tasks.\u00a0It\u2019s a beautiful, unseasonably warm winter day\u2013almost like spring. If I jotted down \u201cgo for a walk,\u201d that activity would instantly lose its appeal. When the idea of going for a stroll remains in my head, I can look forward to it expectantly\u2013because it\u2019s a choice, not a duty. The origin of the English word \u201ctask\u201d is the old French word \u201ctasche,\u201d or \u201cduty\u201d; \u201ctasche\u201d comes from the medieval Latin \u201ctasca\u201d or \u201ctaxa\u201d\u2013literally a \u201ctax\u201d or \u201ccharge.\u201d\u00a0Who wants to do something because it\u2019s a (taxing) duty? Not me! One of the simplest ways to reframe it may be to leave it off your to-do list entirely.\nRelated: This 100-Year-Old To-Do List Hack Still Works Like A Charm\n2. You Can\u2019t Make Yourself Do Things\nThe sheer fact that so many of your to-do lists get left unfinished should give you pause. It turns out that humans are pretty bad at making ourselves do things we don\u2019t like to do. Researchers in recent years have chipped away at the idea that sheer willpower can substantially impact your behavior in any direction. People who chalk up their productivity to great self-control are likely mistaken. (If you\u2019re looking for a more powerful, sustainable source of motivation, here\u2019s what you need to know .)\nadvertisement\nadvertisement\n3. It\u2019s Killing Your Creativity\nTo-do list reminders rarely inspire creative thinking. The phone calls and emails we\u2019re supposed to make aren\u2019t moments of inspiration. It\u2019s more likely we\u2019ll say to ourselves, \u201cWhew, that\u2019s done!\u201d after crossing an item off. Moving from one to the next leaves few \u201cwhite spaces\u201d in our thinking. Yet Wharton researcher Adam Grant points out that creative people don\u2019t act this way; they\u2019re usually procrastinators. In a 2016 TED Talk Grant argued for more time spent deliberating and brainstorming.\u00a0The relentless pressure of the tasks on your to-do list close off those serendipitous possibilities that can make you more productive and successful in the grand scheme.\nRelated: These To-Do List Methods Will Help You Finally Get Organized\nAt one point in my career I was mulling over the idea of starting my own company. About that time my boss dropped by my cubicle and asked me to take a visiting actor, Marshall Bell (Starship Troopers,\u00a0Stand by Me,\u00a0Shawshank Redemption), out to lunch. We went to a local seafood place, and by the end of the meal I\u2019d sketched on the back of a napkin the plan for my new business: Marshall and I would provide coaching to top-tier executives. I\u2019d teach them how to create their speeches, and he\u2019d train them in delivery.\nImagine if I\u2019d passed up that lunch to complete the pressing items on my to-do list! We wouldn\u2019t have launched our startup together, which\u2013many years on\u2013now employs 60 people and reaches clients around the world. It\u2019s harder to think creatively enough to even\u00a0notice\u00a0opportunities like these when you\u2019re focused too narrowly on racking up tiny, short-term wins . . .\nRelated: How Writing To-Do Lists Helps Your Brain (Whether Or Not You Finish Them)\n4.

They lead by being available to others, not shuttering themselves in their offices and checking off items.\nadvertisement\nSure, you\u2019ll always need solo time to do deeply focused work, but that\u2019s rarely the highest-value to you or your career.\u00a0Truly developing your leadership potential means treating every encounter as a chance to persuade and inspire others. And as I argue in my newest book , that includes planned meetings and interviews just as much as spur-of-the-moment exchanges in corridors, elevators , and meeting rooms .\nIf you\u2019re banging away at your to-do list, you\u2019re\u00a0likely to say \u201cnot now\u201d when a coworker pokes her head in your office and asks, \u201cDo you have a minute?\u201d You\u2019re less likely to stop a colleague in the hall and say, \u201cThat was a great idea you shared earlier.\u201d You\u2019ll be on the run\u2013more anxious to knock out today\u2019s tasks than to focus on\u00a0people, share your thoughts, and hear theirs. You won\u2019t get closer to your team, your boss, or your clients by completing your to-do list.\nSo throw it out\u2013so you can break away to create, inspire, listen, and lead.\nadvertisement\nadvertisement\nAbout the author\nJudith Humphrey is founder of The Humphrey Group , a premier leadership communications firm headquartered in Toronto.

        "text": "Talk of a Peace Plan That Snubs Palestinians Roils Middle East\nImage\nBy Anne Barnard , David M. Halbfinger and Peter Baker\nDec. 3, 2017\nBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 In a mysterious trip last month, Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, traveled to Saudi Arabia\u2019s capital for consultations with the hard-charging crown prince about President Trump\u2019s plans for Middle East peace . What was said when the doors were closed, however, has since roiled the region.\nAccording to Palestinian, Arab and European officials who have heard Mr. Abbas\u2019s version of the conversation, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman presented a plan that would be more tilted toward the Israelis than any ever embraced by the American government, one that presumably no Palestinian leader could ever accept.\nThe Palestinians would get a state of their own but only noncontiguous parts of the West Bank and only limited sovereignty over their own territory. The vast majority of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which most of the world considers illegal, would remain. The Palestinians would not be given East Jerusalem as their capital and there would be no right of return for Palestinian refugees and their descendants.\nThe White House on Sunday denied that was its plan, saying it was still months away from finalizing a blueprint for peace, and the Saudi government denied that it supports those positions.\nThat left many in Washington and the Middle East wondering whether the Saudi crown prince was quietly doing the bidding of Mr. Trump, trying to curry favor with the Americans, or freelancing in order to put pressure on the Palestinians or to make any eventual offer sound generous by comparison. Or perhaps Mr. Abbas, weakened politically at home, was sending out signals for his own purposes that he was under pressure from Riyadh.\nEven if the account proves incomplete, it has gained currency with enough players in the Middle East to deeply alarm Palestinians and raise suspicions about Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts. On top of that, advisers have said the president plans to give a speech on Wednesday in which he would recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, even though both sides claim it, a declaration that analysts and regional officials say could undermine America\u2019s role as a theoretically neutral broker.\n\u201cThere is constant speculation and guessing about what we are working on, and this report is more of the same,\u201d said Joshua Raffel, a White House spokesman. \u201cIt is not reflective of the current state of the plan we are working on or the conversations we have had with regional players.\u201d\nImage\nJared Kushner, President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and an adviser on the Middle East, speaking about the administration\u2019s approach to the region at the Saban Forum in Washington on Sunday.CreditJames Lawler Duggan/Reuters\nThe Saudi ambassador to the United States, Prince Khalid bin Salman, said in an email that \u201cthe Kingdom remains committed to a settlement based on the Arab peace initiative of 2002, including East Jerusalem as the capital of a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders. To suggest otherwise is false.\u201d\nMr. Trump assigned the effort to reach what he calls the \u201cultimate deal\u201d to his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, aided by Jason Greenblatt, his top negotiator, and other aides. After nearly a year of listening tours to the region, they are developing a comprehensive plan but have kept details under wraps.\n\u201cWe know what\u2019s in the plan,\u201d Mr. Kushner said in a rare public appearance on Sunday at the Saban Forum, a Middle East conference in Washington hosted by the Brookings Institution. \u201cThe Palestinians know what discussions we\u2019ve had with them. The Israelis know what discussions we\u2019ve had with them.\u201d\nPrince Mohammed\u2019s meeting with Mr. Abbas happened less than two weeks after Mr. Kushner had visited the prince in Riyadh to discuss the peace plan.\nWord of the proposal has shaken up a region already wrestling with multiple conflicts, astonishing Arab officials and Western observers alike. Palestinian officials from both Mr. Abbas\u2019s Fatah party and its rival, Hamas, said they had found the plan insulting and unacceptable.\n\u201cIf the Palestinian leadership were to accept any of the above, the Palestinian people would not let them remain,\u201d said Hassan Yousef, a senior Hamas leader in the West Bank who is also a member of the Palestinian legislature.\nAdding to the shock for Palestinians, according to Palestinian officials from Fatah and Hamas, as well as a senior Lebanese official and several other people briefed on the matter, was the claim that Prince Mohammed had told Mr. Abbas that if he would not accept the terms, he would be pressed to resign to make way for a replacement who would.\nSeveral of the officials said the prince had offered to sweeten the agreement with vastly increased financial support to the Palestinians, and even dangled the possibility of a direct payment to Mr. Abbas, which they said he had refused.\nImage\nConstruction in the Israeli settlement of Brushin in the West Bank.CreditTomas Munita for The New York Times\nPrince Khalid, the Saudi ambassador, said Saudi Arabia fully supported \u201cthe Palestinian leadership under President Abbas\u201d and \u201chas not and will not interfere in the internal affairs of the Palestinians.\u201d\nMr. Abbas\u2019s spokesman, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, dismissed the accounts of the Riyadh meeting and the Saudi proposals as \u201cfake news\u201d that \u201cdoes not exist,\u201d and said the Palestinians were still awaiting a formal proposal from the United States.\nBut the main points of the Saudi proposal as told to Mr. Abbas were confirmed by many people briefed on the discussions between Mr. Abbas and Prince Mohammed, including Mr. Yousef, the senior Hamas leader; several Western officials; a senior Fatah official; a Palestinian official in Lebanon; a senior Lebanese official; and a Lebanese politician, among others.\nAhmad Tibi, a Palestinian member of the Israeli Parliament, described a similar set of ideas that he said the Palestinians had received from the Americans and Israelis: a Palestinian state with only \u201cmoral sovereignty\u201d and noncontiguous territory and without East Jerusalem as the capital; no Israeli settlement evacuation; and no right of return for Palestinian refugees.\nAnd word of the plan has worried even some of the United States\u2019 closest allies, who are eager for clarification from the White House.\nAn adviser to President Emmanuel Macron of France, speaking on condition of anonymity, said French officials had heard a version of some of the Saudi proposals, which sounded very similar to Israel\u2019s opening bid and not acceptable to Palestinians.\nHe said that France had told the Americans that if they wanted to start discussions, they should proceed, but should remember that France and many other countries also have interests and concerns in the region.\nMr. Abbas was alarmed and visibly upset by the proposal, the Fatah official said.\nMr. Yousef, of Hamas, said in an interview that there was consternation that Mr. Abbas and his aides had not revealed and denounced the suggestions publicly.\nImage\nPresident Trump meeting with Mahmoud Abbas in New York in September.CreditDoug Mills/The New York Times\n\u201cAs long as they remain quiet about this, we do have fear of something like this happening,\u201d Mr. Yousef said, adding that if Mr. Abbas received any offer, it is \u201cvery important\u201d that he \u201ctells the Palestinian people that \u2018we were offered 1,2,3,4 and that we refused this offer.\u2019\u201d\nWhile the proposals may sound far-fetched on their face, they have deeply alarmed Palestinian and Arab officials because they come in a context of fast-moving new dynamics in the region.\nPrince Mohammed, 32, is very close to Mr. Kushner, 36, both young men without much foreign policy experience who see themselves as creative reformers able to break with the ossified thinking of the past.\nAnd the Saudi prince has made clear that his top priority in the region is not the Palestinian-Israeli issue, the fulcrum of Arab politics for generations, but confronting Iran.\nRegional officials and analysts say they believe he might be willing to try to force a settlement on Palestinians in order to cement Israeli cooperation against Iran.\nWestern and regional officials said Saudi Arabia\u2019s main goal seems to be normalization of relations with Israel, which would be difficult if the Palestinian struggle remains a regional cause. Saudi Arabia currently has no official relations with Israel but they have been widely reported to have secretly cooperated for years on security issues.\nBut several of Prince Mohammed\u2019s foreign policy efforts so far have sputtered, reflecting what many officials and diplomats in the region say is a lack of understanding of basic regional dynamics, or a willingness to ignore them.\nHis move to isolate Qatar, in part for being too close to Iran, has if anything forced it to become closer to Iran. Last month, his gambit to pressure the Lebanese prime minister, Saad Hariri, to resign \u2014 to isolate Iran\u2019s Lebanese ally, Hezbollah \u2014 backfired, leaving Mr. Hariri still in place and arguably stronger than before.\nImage\nCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia in Riyadh in November.CreditFayez Nureldine/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\nAlarms began to go off across the region last month, when Mr. Abbas started making phone calls to political leaders in the region after he had left Riyadh.\nOne Lebanese government official who received a call was most surprised by what he said was a Saudi suggestion that the Palestinians could have Abu Dis, a suburb of East Jerusalem, as their capital.\nAbu Dis is separated from the city by a wall built as part of Israel\u2019s separation barrier.\nThe Lebanese official said no Arab could accept that kind of gamesmanship, adding that no one could propose that to a Palestinian unless a person lacking experience was trying to flatter the family of the American president.\nA senior Lebanese official and a Lebanese politician, both briefed on the discussions, said Mr. Abbas had been told he had two months to accept the deal or he would be pressured to resign.\nA Palestinian official in Lebanon said one idea floated by the Saudis was to compensate the Palestinians for the loss of West Bank territory by adding territory to the Gaza Strip from Egypt\u2019s Sinai Peninsula, a rocky desert plagued lately by jihadist attacks. A Western official said Egypt already had rejected that idea.\nBut the news on Friday that Mr. Trump would recognize Jerusalem as the Israeli capital suggested that ideas once considered beyond the pale are now seriously being considered.\nRecognizing an Israeli capital there, even without explicitly denying the Palestinians one, would overturn decades of consensus among international peacemakers that any change in Jerusalem\u2019s status must come as part of a negotiated deal.\nPalestinian officials already have said that move would threaten any chance of a two-state solution and could even provoke a new Palestinian uprising.\nOn Sunday, Saeb Erekat, the Palestinian negotiator, said in a statement that the move would create \u201cinternational anarchy and disrespect for global institutions and law.\u201d\nHe said the United States would be destabilizing the region, discouraging supporters of a peaceful solution and \u201cdisqualifying itself to play any role in any initiative towards achieving a just and lasting peace.\u201d\nCorrection:\nAn earlier version of this article incorrectly cited Ahmad Tibi, a Palestinian member of the Israeli Parliament. He described a set of ideas that he said the Palestinians had received from the Israelis and the Americans; he did not confirm the main points of the Saudi proposal.\nAnne Barnard reported from Beirut, David M. Halbfinger from Jerusalem, and Peter Baker from Washington. Reporting was contributed by Maria Abi-Habib and Hwaida Saad from Beirut; Rami Nazzal from Ramallah, West Bank; Alissa J.

        "text": "Best Practices for Survey Analysis\n1. Have a few consistent, high-level questions that are directly tied to your team\u2019s goals\nIt is important to include a consistent set of questions in each survey that directly tie to the team\u2019s goals. We suggest using a dichotomous (yes or no) or numerical scale answer choices so the results can become a quantifiable KPI measured over time or across different experiments.\nFor the lab, a key goal of their experiments is to understand whether or not audiences have an appetite for engaging with news in new formats that take better advantage of the capabilities of mobile devices. Additionally, they want to know if the experiments provide value and are useful and interesting to users. To track against these goals, the lab asks a few questions consistently in every survey. We call them \u201csuccess indication questions.\u201d\nFig. 1. An example of a question included in a survey for one of the Guardian Mobile Innovation Lab\u2019s experiments with notifications.\nIf the majority of respondents answer \u201cyes\u201d to the question, it strongly indicates that the experiment was a success, because they\u2019ve indicated that they\u2019d be interested in receiving notifications again in the future.\nFig. 2. Another example from a survey after a notifications experiment by the Guardian Mobile Innovation Lab.\nAsking whether the alerts were useful and interesting is important to the lab because these are key elements of the experiments\u2019 value proposition.\n2. Include granular questions unique to each experiment that provide context for the consistent high level questions\nDetailed questions about the content or functionality of a news experiment will provide context for the responses to the more general questions. For example, if a user answered that an experiment wasn\u2019t useful to them, it would be essential to include questions that help reveal why. By asking these granular questions, the team can better pinpoint the underlying causes for the success or failure of an experiment.\nAdditionally, responses from these questions will provide context for the behavioral data points collected in your data analytics platform. Google Analytics data, for example, shows how users interacted with the experiment, but not the reasons behind that engagement. For instance, an analysis of Google Analytics data may show that few users engaged with an \u201cOpen live blog\u201d button in an experimental web notification. Without capturing survey feedback, though, it is difficult to determine if users didn\u2019t tap the button because they didn\u2019t understand what it was for, or if they were already satisfied with the amount of information presented in the notification.\nAsking granular questions allows you to validate or disprove any assumptions the team makes about user behavior. Below are a few example questions from a lab survey:\nFig. 3. The question above was asked in regards to a read-and-watch live video feature on the Guardian\u2019s live blog for the Inauguration\nFig. 4. To understand specifically why a user may have used the \u201cUndo\u201d functionality offered in the live US presidential election alerts, a question was added in the survey.\n3. Include demographic questions to facilitate segmentation of survey data\nSegmenting users in data analysis is highly valuable because it can reveal insights about subsets of your audience. Common demographic questions include ones about age, gender, geography, and brand loyalty.\nThe same segments used to analyze survey data can also be applied to behavioral data to gain a holistic understanding of the experience of a subset of the audience. For example, you may want to segment survey data and Google Analytics data by age to reveal any differences in how groups interacted with an experiment.\nAn important demographic question the lab always asks is about loyalty, because they believe that it\u2019s essential to consider a user\u2019s familiarity with Guardian content when assessing success. Analyzing success based on the loyalty of the audience segment could also give teams signals about features and functionality that might appeal to their subscribers.\nFig. 5. By asking the question above, the data collected in subsequent questions in the same survey can be segmented by various levels of Guardian loyalty.\n4. Exclude less actionable questions to balance survey length\nWhile it is very tempting to ask users a lot of questions simply out of curiosity, there is a potential tradeoff with response rate. Lengthy surveys may be offputting to respondents, especially if they\u2019re responding from a phone, which is why it is important to consider the marginal benefit of adding extra questions. Delivering surveys solely through mobile is also a relatively new phenomenon, and as a result there is less extensive research about the optimal survey length for mobile users versus desktop users. However, it can be expected that respondents on mobile devices have a lower tolerance for long surveys, given the small screen size and the likelihood that users will be in transit.\nThere has been some research on the ideal survey lengths for mobile users though: based on results from more than nine million surveys, On Device Research recommends that the optimal survey length for mobile users is 15 questions. Each question beyond the 15th decreases the response rates by 5\u201310%. If you find that you need to ask more questions that tie to your goals, a better option would be to deliver a follow up survey to a more targeted group of respondents from the first survey.\nWe analyzed ten lab surveys, and our initial findings appear to validate the recommendations of On Device Research. Looking at the graph below, the surveys with more than 15 questions formed a cluster that had lower completion rates than those with less than 15 questions.\nFig. 6. A high survey completion rate is desirable because the larger the number of respondents, the more representative the results will be. There are numerous tools and calculators to help determine your ideal sample size by taking into consideration the population size, margin of error, and confidence level.\nIt\u2019s important to note that unlike other kinds of surveys, such as those used for gauging customer satisfaction, which can be distributed continuously over time until reaching your ideal sample size, deploying feedback surveys for news-driven innovation experiments is a bit different. The lab\u2019s surveys are only delivered to participants once, shortly after the end of the news event that has driven the experiment. Still, even a small number of survey responses can help aid the team\u2019s understanding of the users\u2019 experience, however, it\u2019s important not to draw any broad or permanent conclusions from survey results without a statistically representative sample size.\n5. Use screenshots to clarify the questions\nUsers may be unfamiliar with the language or naming conventions your team has established for new features or formats. Thus, when asking detailed questions about particular aspects of an experiment, it\u2019s helpful to include screenshots for clarification. Including screenshots will help minimize the chances of receiving inaccurate answers from survey respondents.\nFig. 7. The question above was asked to better understand the user experience for the lab\u2019s Inauguration mini live player\n6. Aside from free-form or conditional questions, make all questions mandatory\nNot every question in a survey can be answered by all respondents. For example, a question about why a user interacted with a certain feature would not be applicable to someone who did not use it or sign up for it. Instead of making these conditional questions optional, which can muddy the insights, we recommend keeping all questions mandatory but adding an option that serves as the alternative, such as \u201cN/A\u201d or \u201cI didn\u2019t see it\u201d. If you don\u2019t build your questions and answers this way, you might make incorrect assumptions about why someone chose not to answer a question.\nFig. 8. The question above about using the Inauguration Shifting Lenses feature included, \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to view the other lenses\u201d as an answer choice so we would not have to make assumptions about respondents who did not answer\n7. Avoid leading language\nBe cautious of phrasing questions in ways that make users more inclined to answer a certain way. For example, instead of asking \u201cWould you like more information displayed?\u201d a better unbiased alternative question would be \u201cWhat did you think about the amount of information displayed?\u201d. Similarly, instead of asking \u201cDid you find the update annoying?\u201d, you might rephrase the question to \u201cWhat did you think of the update?\u201d. Having accurate and unbiased data is essential when performing analyses that are intended to be actionable, and to provide the team with recommendations to help move the needle for future experiments.",

However, they have not called off next week's strike action in Ireland.\nThe UK pilots' union Balpa, which was not planning to strike next week, said it had written to Ryanair to accept the offer of talks.\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Ryanair tells Today the airline is moving to recognise unions as it's \"time for change\"\nThe carrier said it would recognise unions \"as the representative body for pilots in Ryanair in each of these countries, as long as they establish committees of Ryanair pilots to deal with Ryanair issues, as Ryanair will not engage with pilots who fly for competitor airlines in Ireland or elsewhere\".\nRyanair chief operations officer Peter Bellew told the BBC there were \"no strings\" attached to the offer.\n\"The basis of what we've asked to do is the same as other airlines do around the world and within Europe, so I don't believe there's any strings there.\"\nRyanair called on the unions to cancel the planned strike on 20 December.\nHowever, Mr Bellew said the offer to hold talks about collective bargaining was not just about next week's planned strikes.\n\"This is about the long term. We have 4,500 pilots working for Ryanair at the moment, great aviation professionals, we need to get a basis with them to work going forward.\n\"We feel it's the best grounds to move forward with our workforce for the next 10/20 years where we intend to grow to be the biggest airline in the world.\"\nRyanair's share price fell 8.6% after the invitation to talks became public, amid investors' fears that any change could push up costs.\nMr Bellew said: \"I think there might be some minor changes but I don't think it's going to be material in the overall cost of the company.\"\n'Significant change'\nPilots in Italy had been due to strike on Friday for four hours, between 13:00 and 17:00 CET (12:00-16:00 GMT).\nHowever, following receipt of the letter from Ryanair, the main pilots' union, Anpac, said it had suspended its walkout.\nChief executive Michael O'Leary admitted union recognition would be a \"significant change\" for the airline.\n\"Christmas flights are very important to our customers and we wish to remove any worry or concern that they may be disrupted by pilot industrial action next week,\" he said.\n\"If the best way to achieve this is to talk to our pilots through a recognised union process, then we are prepared to do so.\"\n'Revolutionary'\nIn October, Mr O'Leary wrote to the Ryanair's pilots to offer them better pay and conditions after the airline was forced to cancel thousands of flights.\nAt the time of the cancellations the airline admitted it had \"messed up\" the planning of its pilots' holidays.\nIn his letter, Mr O'Leary also apologised for changes that caused disruptions to their rotas and urged them not to leave the airline.\nAviation expert John Strickland of JLS Consulting said the idea of Ryanair recognising unions was \"revolutionary\" for the company.\n\"I think the company realises they need to pay more, they recognise it's a labour group who they cannot do without, they cannot simply replace pilots off the street on a short-term basis.\n\"There's a global pilot shortage and Ryanair is actually pretty well placed in the pecking order for pilot jobs but they have to make sure these people are on side and not inflame personal feelings with that part of the workforce,\" he added.",

        "text": "Last week, Apple released the firmware of its upcoming smart speaker, the HomePod. It sounds like it was pushed out a bit earlier than expected as it isn\u2019t supposed to come out until later this year. Steve Troughton-Smith took advantage of that to find out that the next iPhone is going to feature facial recognition and a brand new \u201cbezel-less\u201d design.\nPatents and previous rumors already hinted at facial recognition for the iPhone 8. Rumor has it that Apple could either replace or complement the Touch ID fingerprint sensor with a brand new facial recognition technology.\nWhile facial recognition isn\u2019t new, Steve Troughton-Smith found references to infra-red face unlock in BiometricKit, the framework behind Touch ID. Codenamed Pearl ID, the feature should let you unlock your iPhone in the dark, even if you\u2019re looking at your phone from a weird angle with your face partially blocked.\nI can confirm reports that HomePod\u2019s firmware reveals the existence of upcoming iPhone\u2019s infra-red face unlock in BiometricKit and elsewhere pic.twitter.com/yLsgCx7OTZ \u2014 Steve Troughton-Smith (@stroughtonsmith) July 31, 2017\nIf all of this is true, this should be quite a neat replacement for Touch ID. If Apple wants to replace Touch ID with something else, it has to be at least as accurate and fast as Touch ID. The main concern with facial recognition is that you have to hold your phone in front of your face in a brightly lit room.\nIt sounds like Apple is aware of that. Now let\u2019s hope that it only takes a fraction of a second to unlock your phone as the current Touch ID sensor is incredibly fast. Rumor has it that Apple tried to embed the Touch ID sensor in the display itself. But it might not be ready for prime time just yet as Apple has to produce tens of millions of devices per year with this technology.\nAs for the design of the next iPhone, many reports, leaks and dummy devices indicate that Apple is working on a more powerful iPhone 7s as well as a brand new super premium phone. This rumored \u201ciPhone 8\u201d is going to feature a taller screen that is going to completely fill the front of the device, except for the speaker, camera and sensors at the top:\nOne month later, still the very best looking #iPhone8 mockup out there\u2026 \ud83d\ude0f pic.twitter.com/hSCh2C5X6Y \u2014 Steve H.

After checking the patient and detecting a pulse, Ringo gave him a second dose.\n\"The patient had an immediate positive response to the medication and showed instant signs of improvement in his condition,\" police said in a statement.\nThe man was transported to Novato Community Hospital, where he received further treatment. The patient was reportedly conscious and answering questions during his ride to the hospital, police said. He is expected to survive.\nThis is the second time a Novato police officer has saved the life of an opioid-overdosing patient in the past year. Novato police Officer James Rinkor saved a 63-year-old man's life using Naloxone in August.\n\"This is the first save we've had of this in the county,\" Novato police Capt. Matthew McCaffrey said at the time. \"We're happy we were able to do that.\"\nIn June 2017, Novato police received training on the use and administration of Naloxone from the Marin Department of Public Health. Officers have carried the medication in case of emergencies since July 2017.\nThe department works in partnership with RX Safe Marin to train and educate the public on the dangers of opioid addiction and responses to overdose.\nMore than 140 Americans die every day from an opioid overdose, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In October 2017, President Donald Trump declared a public health emergency to address the opioid epidemic.\nRelated:\nNovato Officer Saves Overdosing Man's Life\nImage via Novato Police Department",

        "text": "Sarah Perez @ / 12 months\nAmazon appears to be planning an expansion of Alexa\u2019s existing messaging capabilities to support sending SMS text messages to friends using your Echo device or Alexa app. That means Echo users could then text anyone using voice commands, not only other Echo owners.\nAccording to code found in the Amazon Alexa app, there are references to a new type of phone number \u2013 referred to as your\u00a0\u201cAlexa number\u201d \u2013 which is listed alongside other contact information, like a home phone number, work phone, and mobile. Additionally, references in the code specifically state that users will be able to \u201csend and receive SMS text messages\u201d from their Echo device or the Alexa app.\nNews of SMS messaging was first spotted by the site Voicebot.ai, \u00a0citing an unnamed source.\nIn a screenshot of code they\u2019ve now added to their original report from last week, you can see lines that reference this so-called \u201cAlexa number,\u201d and further details about how this feature works.\nImage credit: Voicebot.ai\nFor example, the code includes references like \u201cMy Alexa number is:\u201d and \u201cWhen you send messages, your contacts will receive them from this number.\u201d\nIt also says \u201cSend and receive SMS text messages using Echo, Echo Dot, Amazon Tap, and the Alexa app,\u201d and offers an example of how to use the feature.\nIt says you can use voice commands like \u201cAlexa, message Jane\u201d and another to check the messages you\u2019ve received. (These commands work today, but don\u2019t extend to SMS.)\nAssuming this is something in active development, rather than placeholder code of some kind, this new feature would go beyond the existing Alexa calling and messaging options that\u00a0 launched in May .\nCurrently, Echo owners can place free voice calls and send text messages using a supported Echo device or the Alexa companion app on their smartphone.\u00a0However, this feature is limited because the only people you can call or text are those who also have the Alexa app and an Echo, Echo Dot, or Echo Show.\nToday, for instance, you can tell Alexa to\u00a0\u201cmessage Jane,\u201d but Jane won\u2019t get an SMS text from you, in that case. She has to read it in her Alexa app, or ask Echo to check her messages. If the code above actually does what it promises, then that would change when this feature goes live. Jane would then get a SMS text sent from your \u201cAlexa number.\u201d\nAt present, the existing messaging feature requires you upload your phone contacts to your Alexa app to get started. This \u00a0led to some privacy issues at launch \u2013 users could message you, call or send voice messages to you as long as they had your phone number and the Alexa app installed.\nAmazon, in a response to backlash about this problem, \u00a0rolled out a contact blocking setting \u00a0shortly after the feature debuted.\nAbove: Amazon\u2019s website detailing the feature as it works today\nAn \u201cAlexa number\u201d could come into play here as another means of protecting user privacy.\nYou could give out your \u201cAlexa number\u201d to those you want to be able text or call you through Echo and the Alexa platform, when you don\u2019t feel comfortable enough to give them your \u201creal\u201d phone number.\nThen you could use Alexa voice commands to send actual SMS texts to those recipients, or you could type your texts in the Alexa app.\nThis is a similar value proposition offered by competing voice services, like Google Voice or Skype, for example, as well as apps that offer you temporary and virtual phone numbers, like Burner.\nBeyond the screenshot from Voicebot\u2019s report above, there are other references to this \u201cAlexa number\u201d that can be found in the Alexa Android app (the APK file)\u2019s code.\nAbove and below: code showing an \u201cAlexa\u201d phone number type\nHere, you\u2019ll see this \u201cAlexa number\u201d is listed as one of the phone number types a user can have on file in addition to others, like a home phone, work phone, mobile, and \u201cother\u201d \u2013 all standard contact fields. The Alexa number field in this APK contains an actual phone number with an area code, which hints that Amazon may assign a virtual number to Echo owners.\nAmazon already has a solution to do this, Voicebot had pointed out \u2013 AWS\u2019 Simple Notification Service ( SNS ) is often used by businesses who want to send broadcast SMS messages to their customers, among other things.\nAnother interesting tidbit is that a reference in the code (see the first image) also says that \u201cMessaging is available for free for a limited time.\u201d\nThat could mean that being able to send SMS texts is something Amazon is considering rolling out as a paid upgrade. That would be notable, if true, as Amazon isn\u2019t really monetizing Echo right now beyond the cost of selling the hardware itself, and from those consumers who use its voice shopping features.\nOf course, finding code references doesn\u2019t always mean that a feature is in active development or on the near-term roadmap. But there\u2019s quite a lot of code here to dismiss this as being placeholder text, written \u201cjust in case\u201d Amazon\u2019s decides to go that route.\nIn addition, it seems clear that Amazon is highly interested in the potential for Echo to become a communication device. It launched the Echo Show , which has a disruptive new way to stay in touch called \u201cDrop In,\u201d where you literally just pop up on a friend or family member\u2019s video screen.\nPlus, the Alexa app today defaults to the \u201cConversations\u201d screen, instead of the app\u2019s actual \u201cHome\u201d screen \u2013 something meant to encourage adoption of the messaging service.\nReached for comment about Alexa\u2019s planned SMS texting feature, an Amazon spokesperson only said \u201cper company policy, we don\u2019t comment on rumors or speculation.\u201d\nKnow more?

Interactive by Tyler Dukes // Analysis by Kelly Hinchcliffe\nSchools are also judged on whether their students exceeded, met or did not meet academic growth expectations during the year. Connections Academy and Virtual Academy have not met growth in the two years they've been open.\n\"You can see areas of improvement from our first year as well as those that need more attention and effort,\" Medley said. \"Plans were devised during the summer to tackle those areas and we have implemented them from the beginning of this current school year.\"\nThe schools were launched in 2015 as part of a four-year pilot program to determine whether virtual charters can succeed in the state. They are similar to regular charter schools but allow students to stay home and take all their classes online. Parents typically serve as learning coaches and act as a liaison between their children and teachers.\nSince Connections Academy and Virtual Academy opened, they have struggled with low test scores and high withdrawal rates. A recent WRAL News investigation found that more than 30 percent of the schools' students withdrew the first year and 27 percent withdrew last year. Each school enrolls about 2,000 students from across the state each year and loses anywhere from 550 to 650 annually, according to state records\nVirtual charter school leaders say their withdrawal numbers appear inflated because of the unique students they serve, some of whom only enroll for a brief time. Lawmakers have allowed the schools to stop counting certain students who leave, including those who withdraw within 30 days, leading to drastically lower withdrawal rates of 5 percent each.\nIn interviews with WRAL News earlier this year, leaders of the virtual charter schools acknowledged their low test scores and high withdrawal rates and asked for patience as they try to improve.\n\"We've gotta build a culture. We've gotta build an image. We've gotta build a brand,\" Currie, Connections Academy's superintendent, said. \"When we got our test scores back (last year), it was baseline data for us. We knew kids came to us not strong in math.\"\nAt Virtual Academy, a common misconception is that the school enrolls only high-performing students, according to Medley.\n\"Everybody assumes that we have the best of the best. It's not the case,\" he said.\nMedley noted that 66 percent of his students receive free and reduced lunch and that the school enrolls a slightly higher than average percentage of special education students.\n\"Forty percent of our third-graders came to us in the lowest quartile in the state,\" he added. \"Often at the high school level, families (are) choosing us as a last-ditch effort for their kid to graduate.\"\nNorth Carolina's virtual charter schools are not alone in their academic struggles. A 2015 study by Stanford University offered a snapshot of the country's 200 online charter schools and the 200,000 students they serve. The study found that the majority of online charter school students in the U.S. had far weaker academic growth in both math and reading compared to their traditional public school peers.\nHowever, virtual charter school leaders point to another study, published in the the Journal of Online Learning Research, which found the following:\nStudents who transfer into a virtual charter school experience academic regression in the first year.\nStudents who remained enrolled in the virtual charter school beyond a second year experienced an academic recovery.\nStudents remaining with the virtual charter school three years experienced a complete academic recovery and saw significant improvement in years four and five. The value-add in years four and five outpaced that of their matched peers.\nCorrection: A previous version of this story incorrectly listed some of the schools' scores.

        "text": "Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), center, gestures during a news conference in Washington Tuesday to urge Senate approval of an international agreement for protecting the rights of individuals with disabilities. The measure failed on Tuesday. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\nThe Senate has failed to ratify an international treaty intended to protect the rights of those with disabilities, as a bloc of conservatives opposed the treaty believing it could interfere with U.S. law.\nThe Senate voted 61 to 38 to ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons With Disabilities, a tally that fell short of the two-thirds needed to sign on to an international treaty.\nThe 2006 treaty, which forbids discrimination of the disabled, has enjoyed bipartisan support. Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the treaty would encourage other nations to develop the kind of protections the United States adopted 22 years ago with the Americans With Disabilities Act. The international treaty\u2019s thrust, he said, was a message: \u201cBe more like us.\u201d\nBut the treaty has split Republicans. Among its most vocal supporters were Republican war veterans, including President George H.W. Bush and former senator Bob Dole, who was injured in World War II and made a rare return to the Senate floor Tuesday to observe the vote and lend his stature.\nOther conservatives were deeply suspicious of the United Nations, which would oversee treaty obligations. Those who opposed the treaty included former senator and Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum, the father of a developmentally disabled child who had traveled to Capitol Hill last week to encourage fellow Republicans to vote no.\nHe and other conservatives argued that the treaty could relinquish U.S. sovereignty to a U.N. committee charged with overseeing a ban on discrimination and determining how the disabled, including children, should be treated. They particularly worried that the committee could violate the rights of parents who choose to home school their disabled children.\n\u201cThis is a direct assault on us,\u201d Santorum said.\nNations that have signed on to the treaty include China, Iran and Syria. Opponents said that American approval might give the impression that the United States accepts how those nations treat their disabled citizens.\n\u201cThe hard reality is that there are nation-states, like China, who do like to sign up to these organizations and gain the reputation for doing good things while, in fact, not doing good things,\u201d said Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.)\nSupporters dismissed those fears as paranoid, noting that the treaty would change nothing in U.S. law without further approval from Congress.\n\u201cWith these provisions, the United States can join the convention as an expression \u2014 an expression \u2014 of our leadership on disability rights without ceding any of our ability to decide for ourselves how best to address those issue in our law,\u201d said Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.).\nThe risk of rejection grew after Santorum and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) announced that they had gathered the signatures of 36 fellow Republicans on a letter opposing the adoption of the measure during this month\u2019s lame-duck session.\nBut its proponents had pushed forward in hopes of peeling off a handful of Republican opponents. Senators were greeted this week near their basement subway by veterans and others in wheelchairs who pushed for support.\nIn deference to the solemnity of the vote, Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) asked that senators cast their votes while seated at their desks \u2014 a rare move to observe the chamber\u2019s formal rules that require each senator to respond to the clerk\u2019s announcement of their name with an \u201caye\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d\nIn practice, senators usually vote by giving a signal to the clerk \u2014 sometimes a thumbs up or down.",

        "text": "7Acknowledgements\nWhat You Should Know\nSurveillance law was designed to place a short leash on Internet data collection inside the United States, and a long one on Internet data collection abroad. That is, surveillance on U.S. soil is subject to statutory and judicial restrictions that do not apply abroad.\nBecause the modern Internet is agnostic to national borders, purely domestic communications can pass through foreign countries\u2014where they are sometimes \u201cincidentally\u201d collected by the NSA.\nFurthermore, the NSA has the technical capacity to deliberately reroute Internet traffic to a location that is better suited, operationally, to surveillance. This method, known as \u201ctraffic shaping,\u201d could also be used to divert U.S. traffic abroad, in order to evade the stricter legal restrictions that apply on U.S. soil.\nThere is therefore a loophole that could be exploited to evade legal restrictions on domestic surveillance.\nCongress could eliminate this loophole by eliminating the statutory distinctions between collection abroad and collection on U.S. soil.\nSince the disclosures of Edward Snowden in 2013, the U.S. government has assured its citizens that the National Security Agency (NSA) cannot spy on their electronic communications without the approval of a special surveillance judge. Domestic communications, the government says , are protected by statute and the Fourth Amendment. 1 In practice, however, this is no longer strictly true. These protections are real, but they no longer cover as much ground as they did in the past.\nWhen Congress wrote the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) in 1978, 2 it was trying to set a short leash on the NSA at home and a long one overseas. 3 The NSA could not tap into communications inside the United States without following strict rules, but it had a free hand to intercept data elsewhere. Even now this sounds like common sense. The NSA is not supposed to spy at home, but spying abroad is central to its job. One policy problem we face today, however, is that the realities of the modern Internet have blurred the distinction between spying at home and spying abroad.\nThe modern Internet tends to be agnostic to geopolitical borders. There are multiple alternate routes from any Internet-connected machine to any other. Internet traffic travels along the cheapest or least-congested route, not the shortest route. 4 Internet data is backed up in data-centers located around the globe, so that data can be recovered even in the face of local disasters (power outages, earthquakes, and so on). 5 For these reasons, it is commonplace for purely domestic communications to cross international boundaries. An email sent from San Jose to New York may be routed through Internet devices located in Frankfurt, 6 or be backed up on computers located in Ireland . 7\nInternational detours and routing changes happen automatically, without human intervention. Even so, they offer an opportunity to the NSA. With some exceptions, the surveillance of raw Internet traffic from foreign points of interception can be conducted entirely under the authority of the president. Congressional and judicial limitations come into play only when that raw Internet traffic is used to \u201cintentionally target a U.S. person,\u201d a legal notion that is narrowly interpreted to exclude the bulk collection, storage, and even certain types of computerized data analysis. 8 This is a crucial issue, because American data is routed across foreign communications cables. Several leading thinkers, 9 including Jennifer Granick in her recent report for The Century Foundation , have drawn attention to the creeping risk of domestic surveillance that is conducted from afar.\nThis report describes a novel and more disturbing set of risks. As a technical matter, the NSA does not have to wait for domestic communications to naturally turn up abroad. In fact, the agency has technical methods that can be used to deliberately reroute Internet communications. The NSA uses the term \u201ctraffic shaping\u201d to describe any technical means the deliberately reroutes Internet traffic to a location that is better suited, operationally, to surveillance. Since it is hard to intercept Yemen\u2019s international communications from inside Yemen itself, the agency might try to \u201c shape \u201d the traffic so that it passes through communications cables located on friendlier territory. 10 Think of it as diverting part of a river to a location from which it is easier (or more legal) to catch fish.\nThe NSA has clandestine means of diverting portions of the river of Internet traffic that travels on global communications cables.\nCould the NSA use traffic shaping to redirect domestic Internet traffic\u2014emails and chat messages sent between Americans, say\u2014to foreign soil, where its surveillance can be conducted beyond the purview of Congress 11 and the courts? It is impossible to categorically answer this question, due to the classified nature of many national-security surveillance programs, regulations and even of the legal decisions made by the surveillance courts. Nevertheless, this report explores a legal, technical, and operational landscape that suggests that traffic shaping could be exploited to sidestep legal restrictions imposed by Congress and the surveillance courts.\nHow Did We Get Here?\nThe Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution has led to some strong protections for domestic communications. If, for example, the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) wants to monitor electronic communications between two Americans as part of a criminal investigation, it is required by law to obtain a warrant. 12 If the intelligence community wants to intercept Americans\u2019 communications inside the United States, for national security reasons, then it must follow rules established by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). 13\nMeanwhile, when the intelligence community wants to intercept traffic abroad, its surveillance is mostly regulated by Executive Order 12333 (EO 12333), 14 issued by Ronald Reagan in 1981. 15 Surveillance programs conducted under FISA are subject to oversight by the FISA Court and regular review by the intelligence committees in Congress. Meanwhile, surveillance programs under EO 12333 are largely unchecked by either the legislative 16 or judicial branch. Instead, EO 12333 programs are conducted entirely under the authority of the president. Moreover, the implementing guidelines for programs under EO 12333 offer fewer protections for Americans\u2019 privacy than those under FISA. 17\nIn other words, one set of rules apply for surveillance of communications intercepted at home, and another set altogether for communications intercepted abroad.\nThis distinction made sense when FISA and EO 12333 were first established in the 1970s and 1980s. Back then, spying on a foreign target typically meant intercepting communications overseas, and spying on American targets meant intercepting communications on U.S. soil. Today, however, Internet technologies have largely obviated these distinctions. The modern Internet has allowed Americans to communicate in a manner that is largely agnostic to geopolitical boundaries.\nSign up for updates.\nFollow us\nWhere Do We Go From Here?\nThe modern Internet has changed the way that Americans communicate. These changes call for a fundamental realignment of U.S. surveillance law. Specifically, the legal boundaries that distinguish interception of Internet traffic on U.S. territory from interception abroad must be broken down. Americans\u2019 Internet traffic should enjoy the same legal protections, regardless of whether it is intercepted on U.S. territory, or intercepted abroad.\nWe have seen these legal boundaries break down when it suits the purpose of intelligence community. A decade ago, FISA surveillance required warrants 18 from the FISA Court. In 2008, however, FISA was amended to allow warrantless surveillance on U.S. territory, as long as the operation acquires \u201cforeign intelligence\u201d and does not \u201cintentionally target a U.S. person.\u201d 19 In 2007, J. Michael McConnell, the director of national intelligence, advocated for this by stating that :\nFISA originally placed a premium on the location of the collection. Legislators in 1978 could not have been expected to predict an integrated global communications grid that makes geography an increasingly irrelevant factor. Today a single communication can transit the world even if the two people communicating are only a few miles apart. 20\nExactly the same argument applies in reverse. The fact that \u201cgeography is an increasingly irrelevant factor\u201d similarly justifies protections for American\u2019s communications when their traffic is intercepted abroad. Indeed, there is evidence that indicates that if authorities have the option to collect the same Internet traffic in the United States (under FISA) or abroad (under EO 12333), they may opt to collect the traffic abroad under the more permissive EO 12333 rules. 21 In that scenario, the NSA can take advantage of looser restrictions when it happens to find U.S. communications overseas.\nMoreover, the NSA does not need to wait until U.S. communications happen to turn up overseas. Instead, the NSA could use \u201ctraffic-shaping\u201d techniques to deliberately send traffic from within the U.S to points of interception on foreign territory, where it could be swept up as part of operations that would be illegal if conducted on U.S. territory. Given the classified nature of the agency\u2019s work, and even of its interpretations of the law, it is impossible to categorically determine if the NSA is currently using traffic shaping for this purpose. Nevertheless, this report presents an interpretation of the law suggesting that operations that \u201cshape\u201d American traffic from U.S. territory to abroad might be regulated entirely by EO 12333.\nThis presents a serious policy issue. Fortunately, there is an upcoming opportunity to address this issue, when portions of the 2008 FISA Amendments Act come up for renewal in December 2017. While the law appears to be silent on traffic shaping, the renewal debate will offer an opportunity for Congress to take up this question. Congress could expand FISA to cover the surveillance of any and all traffic collected abroad.\nTo do this, Congress could revise the definition of \u201celectronic surveillance\u201d in the text of the FISA statute, which determines the types of surveillance that are regulated by FISA. FISA\u2019s definition of \u201celectronic surveillance\u201d has hardly been updated since 1978. The definition ought to be modernized so that it is neutral on the geographic location where traffic is intercepted, and also neutral on the specifics of the technologies used to intercept that traffic. By modernizing this definition, Congress could disentangle the legal protections for Americans from the vagaries of the rapidly-evolving technologies that Americans use for their communications.\nThis report starts with a look at FISA, which largely regulates surveillance on U.S. territory. It then describes EO 12333, which largely regulates surveillance abroad. EO 12333 surveillance is subject to fewer legal restraints than surveillance under FISA. The report then discusses why Internet traffic from U.S. persons might naturally flow abroad, where it can be swept up as part of bulk surveillance programs under EO 12333. The report then looks at documents that suggest that, when authorities have the choice of collecting the same Internet traffic under FISA (on U.S. soil) or under EO 12333 (abroad), they may choose the more permissive EO 12333 regime. Thus, when American traffic naturally flows abroad, EO 12333 can be used to circumvent the legal restrictions in FISA. The report then considers what is known about NSA\u2019s traffic shaping capabilities, and how they might lawfully be used to reroute traffic from inside U.S. borders to foreign soil. The report then concludes with several policy recommendations that can protect American traffic when it is collected on foreign soil.\nThe Legal Authorities Governing Internet Surveillance\nA layperson reading the text of the Fourth Amendment might naturally conclude that the government needs a warrant whenever it conducts surveillance. 22 However, over two centuries of legal precedent and legislation have passed since the Bill of Rights was first adopted, defining whether and how the Fourth Amendment applies in various situations. One important legal principle , established by the U.S. Supreme Court, holds that that the Fourth Amendment does not apply to foreign individuals located outside U.S. territory. 23\nThis principle\u2014that foreign individuals located outside the United States are not protected by the Fourth Amendment\u2014is reflected in the complex web of legal authorities that regulate Internet surveillance.\nThis principle\u2014 that foreign individuals located outside the United States are not protected by the Fourth Amendment \u2014is reflected in the complex web of legal authorities that regulate Internet surveillance. This report focuses on two of these legal authorities\u2014FISA and EO 12333\u2014each of which comes with its own underlying set of legal interpretations, precedents, and policies, some of which are classified. 24 This section first discusses each legal authority, and then describes why modern Internet technologies have caused a blurring of the purviews of these two distinct legal authorities.\nThe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA)\nThe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) was signed into law in 1978 during the Carter administration, primarily as a reaction to the intelligence abuses that came to light during the 1970s. 25 FISA was intended to \u201c relieve all Americans of that dread of unchecked surveillance power and that fear of unauthorized official eavesdropping \u201d 26 by providing judicial and legislative oversight for government surveillance. FISA established the non-public FISA Court, which issues warrants 27 for surveillance on U.S. territory when \u201ca significant purpose of the surveillance is to obtain foreign intelligence information.\u201d 28 FISA Court decisions are typically classified. 29\nWhen FISA was first passed in 1978, legislators supposed that surveillance operations conducted on domestic territory were mostly likely to affect Americans. Because the Fourth Amendment applies to Americans located on domestic territory, 30 the original FISA statute generally required warrants 31 from the FISA Court for operations conducted on domestic territory.\nIn 2008, this policy shifted when Congress passed the FISA Amendment Act (FAA). The FAA introduced Section 702, which allows warrantless surveillance on U.S. soil, as long as the operation acquires \u201cforeign intelligence\u201d and does not \u201cintentionally target a U.S. person.\u201d Importantly, the legal notion of \u201cintentional targeting\u201d does not rule out large-scale warrantless surveillance of Americans. 32 Passage of the FAA was motivated, in part, by the fact that Internet traffic tends to ignore geopolitical borders. Specifically, the intelligence community argued 33 that foreigners\u2019 traffic that crosses the U.S. borders could be surveilled without a warrant, because the Fourth Amendment does not apply to foreigners.\nWhen the FAA was brought to a vote, it was met with opposition from number of legislators. As a concession to these legislators, the FAA was amended to include a \u201creaffirmation that FISA is the \u2018exclusive\u2019 means of conducting intelligence wiretaps\u2014a provision that . . . would . . . prevent eva[sion] of court scrutiny.\u201d 34 However, a deeper look at this exclusivity clause indicates that it is less protective than may initially appear. Specifically, \u201cexclusivity\u201d only applies to \u201c electronic surveillance ,\u201d a legal term that is narrowly defined in the text of the FISA statute. 35 Among other things, FISA\u2019s definition of \u201celectronic surveillance\u201d does not cover tapping communication cables located abroad for the purpose of obtaining \u201cforeign intelligence\u201d that does not \u201cintentionally target a U.S. person.\u201d 36\nExecutive Order 12333\nWhen the NSA conducts the majority of its SIGINT activities (that is, \u201csignals intelligence,\u201d or intelligence-gathering by interception of electronic signals), it does so pursuant to the authority provided by Executive Order (EO) 12333 , first issued in 1981 by the Reagan administration. 37\nEO 12333 falls solely under the executive branch, and is generally more permissive than FISA. 38 One key distinction is that programs under FISA are subject to review by the FISA Court. FISA violations must be reported to the court, and violators can face criminal liabilities. Programs conducted under EO 12333, however, are not reviewed by any court, and violators are subject only to internal sanctions, not criminal charges. 39\nThis is a crucial point. The laws governing surveillance date back to 1970s and 1980s\u2014long before the Internet was popularly used for personal communications\u2014and are therefore inherently ambiguous about modern surveillance techniques and their lawfulness. Under FISA, any such ambiguities can be resolved on a case-by-case basis in front of the FISA Court. Under EO 12333, however, these ambiguities are dealt with internally, by lawyers and policymakers whose job it is to maximize the effectiveness of surveillance operations. By avoiding judicial review and the potential for criminal penalties, EO 12333 creates a much more favorable environment for surveillance.\nSurveillance under EO 12333 is not without limits and boundaries. It is subject to self-imposed rules created by the executive branch and the intelligence community. It must be conducted abroad and must not \u201cintentionally target a U.S. person.\u201d 40 So, to properly understand EO 12333 surveillance, we need to understand how the intelligence community interprets the legal notion of \u201cintentional targeting.\u201d\nIntentional Targeting under EO 12333\nAs it turns out, the intelligence community\u2019s interpretation of \u201cintentional targeting\u201d is pretty permissive. It does not, for example, rule out bulk collection, storage, 41 and even certain types of algorithmic analyses 42 of Internet traffic that it collects abroad\u2014even if this traffic is American in origin, containing stockpiles of data about U.S. persons.\nInstead, \u201ctargeting\u201d is interpreted as occurring only when an analyst searches this data by applying a \u201cselector\u201d that implicates a specific individual, group, or topic. 43\nThe narrow interpretation of \u201ctargeting\u201d has significant implications on privacy for U.S. persons. For instance, the NSA has built a \u201c search engine \u201d 44 that allows analysts to hunt through raw data collected in bulk through various means. If a human analyst uses that search engine to search for communications linked to a specific email address, Facebook username, or other personal identifier\u2014a \u201c selector \u201d 45 \u2014then that counts as \u201cintentional targeting.\u201d However, if an analyst obtains information using search terms that do not implicate a single individual\u2014for example, words or phrases such as \u201cYemen\u201d or \u201cnuclear proliferation\u201d\u2014the communications swept up as part of this search, such as an email between two Americans discussing current events in Yemen, are not considered to be \u201cintentionally targeted.\u201d 46 Instead, these communications are merely \u201c incidentally collected .\u201d 47\nU.S. surveillance techniques are classified, which prevents outside observers from making categorical statements about how far the intelligence community stretches this notion of \u201cincidental collection.\u201d However, John Napier Tye , a former U.S. State Department official who had access to classified information about EO 12333, described one possible interpretation of \u201cintentional targeting\u201d:\nHypothetically, under 12333 the NSA could target a single foreigner abroad. And hypothetically if, while targeting that single person, they happened to collect every single Gmail and every single Facebook message on the company servers not just from the one person who is the target, but from everyone\u2014then the NSA could keep and use the data from those three billion other people. That\u2019s called \u201cincidental collection.\u201d I will not confirm or deny that that is happening, but there is nothing in 12333 to prevent that from happening. 48\nWhile it is remains unclear exactly how far the intelligence community stretches the notion of \u201cincidental collection,\u201d even the interpretation of what constitutes \u201ccollection\u201d itself seems to create a favorable environment for large-scale surveillance. That is, when intelligence agencies obtain and store data from a tapped communications cable, this data is not even considered to be \u201c collected \u201d until it is processed and analyzed. 49\nThe remainder of this report considers surveillance that is not \u201cintentionally targeted,\u201d yet nevertheless still significantly implicates the privacy of Americans.\nHow Can Surveillance under EO 12333 Impact Americans?\nIn 1981, when EO 12333 was first issued, one could have concluded American communications are unlikely to be \u201cincidentally collected\u201d as part of bulk surveillance operations conducted on foreign soil. Today, this is no longer the case. 50 The Internet is agnostic to national borders: communications between two persons in the same country sometimes cross into other countries, as networks seek the most-efficient, least-congested, or lowest-cost route from sender to recipient.\nHow Americans\u2019 Internet Traffic Typically\u2014and Commonly\u2014Flows Abroad\nThe collection of communications between Americans on U.S. territory is governed by FISA. 51 However, if those same communications can be \u201cincidentally collected\u201d abroad, then collection is governed by EO 12333. 52 But how do communications between two Americans typically travel abroad?\nIt can sometimes be faster or cheaper for Internet service providers to send traffic through a foreign country. The United States has a well-connected communications infrastructure, so it is rare to find a case where traffic sent between two domestic computers naturally travels through a foreign country. Nevertheless, these cases do occur. One such case (identified by Dyn Research\u2019s Internet measurement infrastructure) is presented in Figure\u00a01.\nThe \u201ctraceroute\u201d presented in Figure\u00a01 shows how Internet traffic sent between two domestic computers travels through foreign territory. The traffic originates at a computer in San Jose and is routed through Frankfurt before arriving at its final destination in New York. The left column shows the Internet Protocol (IP) address of each Internet device on the route, the middle column names the Internet Service Provider (ISP) that owns this device, and the right column shows the location of the device.\nFIGURE 1.\nReplicating U.S.-based data in foreign data centers is a common industry practice, in order to ensure that data can be recovered even in the face of local disasters (power outages, earthquakes, and so on). 53 Google, for instance, maintains data centers in the United States, Taiwan, Singapore, Chile, Ireland, the Netherlands, Finland, and Belgium, and its privacy policy states : \u201cGoogle processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your personal information on a server located outside the country where you live.\u201d 54 If two Americans use their Google accounts to communicate, their emails and chat logs may be backed up on Google\u2019s data centers abroad, and thus can be \u201cincidentally collected\u201d as part of EO 12333 surveillance.\nFIGURE 2.\nMap of Google data center locations. Source: Google .\nIn fact, this is not a hypothetical scenario. In October 2013, the Washington Post reported that the NSA tapped communication cables between Google and Yahoo! data centers located abroad, sweeping up over 180 million user communications records. 55 According to the Washington Post, \u201cNSA documents about the effort refer directly to \u2018full take,\u2019 \u2018bulk access\u2019 and \u2018high volume\u2019 operations.\u201d Crucially, this collection was performed abroad. Meanwhile, a FISA Court ruling from 2011 suggests this operation would have been illegal had it been performed on U.S. territory. 56\nThe Vulnerability of Americans under EO 12333\nHow many American communication records are swept up as part of bulk surveillance programs conducted abroad under EO 12333? It is hard to know. In August 2014, officials told the New York Times that \u201cthe NSA had never studied the matter and most likely could not come up with a representative sampling.\u201d 57 However, there is clear evidence suggesting that the NSA does analyze U.S. person data that is \u201cincidentally collected\u201d under EO 12333.\nU.S. surveillance law applies weaker legal protections to communications metadata (information about who contacts who, when and for long) than to communications contents (information contained in the messages themselves). This issue is crucial to the policy issues considered by this report, because analysis of metadata collected under EO 12333 is far less restrained than analysis of metadata collected under FISA.\nWhy is there a distinction between content and metadata? The notion that communications metadata deserves weaker privacy protections dates back to 1979 , when our computers were much less powerful. 58 Today, however, computer scientists have shown that subjecting large volumes of metadata to powerful algorithmic analysis can be very invasive of individual privacy. 59 In fact, General Michael Hayden, former director of the NSA, has famously said that \u201cWe kill people based on metadata.\u201d 60 Nevertheless, communications metadata continues to enjoy weaker legal protections than communications content.\n\u201cFormer NSA Boss: \u2018We kill people based on metadata.\u2019\u201d Source:\u00a0 YouTube .\nHow does this play out under EO 12333? If the contents of an American\u2019s communication are \u201cincidentally collected\u201d under EO 12333, then human analysts are generally required to redact (or \u201cmask\u201d or \u201cminimize\u201d) that information out of intelligence reports. 61\nMeanwhile, the NSA\u2019s procedures for dealing with metadata collected under EO 12333 are far less stringent. For instance, the NSA\u2019s procedures under EO 12333 allow for \u201ccontact chaining\u201d of metadata, using information about who communicates with whom to map out the relationships between individuals. Prior to 2010, the NSA was required to stop \u201ccontact chaining\u201d once the chain encountered metadata belonging to an American. In 2010, the Obama administration unilaterally reversed this policy , allowing the NSA to use U.S. person information in contact chains that are derived from metadata \u201cincidentally collected\u201d under EO 12333. 62 Just before leaving office, the Obama administration further expanded this authority beyond just the NSA to the entire intelligence community (including the CIA, FBI, DHS, DEA, among other agencies), permitting \u201c communications metadata analysis, including contact chaining, of raw [EO 12333] data . . . for valid, documented foreign intelligence or counterintelligence purposes . . . without regard to the location or nationality of the communicants .\u201d 63\nThis is expansion of authority to use \u201ccontact chaining\u201d under EO 12333 is significant, because the USA FREEDOM ACT of 2015 forbids contact chaining for more than two \u201chops\u201d away from a target, when using metadata from telephone-call records that were collected on U.S. soil. (That is, the chain may only include the \u201cintentional target,\u201d all of the target\u2019s contacts, and all of the contacts\u2019 contacts.) Meanwhile, under EO 12333, the intelligence community may create contact chains of unlimited length. Moreover, while contact chaining under the USA FREEDOM Act may be done only for counterterrorism purposes, under EO 12333, a \u201cforeign intelligence\u201d purpose suffices. The latter creates more latitude for surveillance, because the EO 12333 definition of \u201cforeign intelligence\u201d is broad, covering information \u201crelating to the capabilities, intentions and activities of foreign . . . organizations or persons.\u201d 64\nIn other words, the reforms embodied in the USA FREEDOM ACT, which extend greater privacy protections to Americans, can be sidestepped when the metadata of U.S. persons is collected on abroad, rather than on U.S. territory . 65\nIs EO 12333 Being Used as an End Run around FISA?\nThere is further evidence that EO 12333 authority has been used to sidestep the protections for U.S. persons under FISA. Journalist Marcy Wheeler points to a 2011 NSA training module that instructs analysts to run their intended searches on both FISA data and EO 12333 data. If identical results are found, analysts are told that they may want to share them using the more permissive rules for disseminating information under EO 12333, rather than the more restrictive FISA rules. 66 The module also includes the following training question:\nTRUE or FALSE: If a query result indicates that the source of information is both Executive Order 12333 collection and [FISA] collection, then the analyst must handle the E.O. 12333 result according to the [FISA] rules.\na) True\nb) False\nThe module indicates that the correct answer is \u201cFalse.\u201d\nThere is a particularly telling detail that may corroborate suspicions that authorities are turning to EO 12333, rather than FISA, to conduct surveillance. In 2011, the NSA shut down a program that was collecting American email metadata, in bulk, on U.S. territory. This program was overseen by the FISA Court. The New York Times and Marcy Wheeler point to documents indicating that the program was shut down, in part, because \u201cother [legal] authorities can satisfy certain foreign intelligence requirements\u201d that the bulk email records program \u201chad been designed to meet.\u201d One of these legal authorities is the rules for collecting metadata on foreign territory under EO 12333. 67\nFinally, in April 2017, the NSA \u201c stopped some its activities \u201d under FISA that collect U.S. persons\u2019 communications on U.S. territory, 68 where \u201c Americans\u2019 emails and texts [are] exchanged with people overseas that simply mention identifying terms\u2014like email addresses\u2014for foreigners whom the agency is spying on, but are neither to nor from those targets.\u201d 69 According to the NSA, a motivation for halting this program was a \u201cseveral earlier, inadvertent . . . incidents related to queries involving U.S. person information\u201d 70 that failed to comply with the rules laid out by the FISA Court. However, the New York Times reported that \u201cthere was no indication that the N.S.A. intended to cease this type of collection abroad, where legal limits set by the Constitution and [FISA] largely do not apply.\u201d 71\nThese examples suggest that authorities can sidestep the judicial oversight required by FISA, simply by intercepting traffic on foreign territory. But this raises an interesting question: What would happen to Americans\u2019 privacy rights if an increasing portion of the flow of American communications were somehow diverted onto foreign territory?\nTraffic Shaping to Force U.S. Persons\u2019 Communications Abroad\nAs stated earlier, American Internet traffic can sometimes be routed abroad, naturally, in the name of efficiency, or when Americans view content that is hosted or stored on computers located in other nations. But American Internet traffic can also be deliberately diverted onto foreign territory by exploiting modern Internet technologies. The NSA uses the term \u201c traffic shaping \u201d to describe any technical method that is used to redirect the routes taken by Internet traffic. 72\nIt is conceivable that traffic shaping could be used as a method to redirect American Internet traffic from within the United States to a tapped communication cable located on foreign soil. This traffic could then be \u201cincidentally collected\u201d from the foreign cable under EO 12333, and thus could be stored, analyzed, and disseminated under the more permissive EO 12333 rules.\nDoes the NSA does have the technical capability to perform traffic shaping? There is sufficient evidence to suggest that they do. That said, there is no evidence that the NSA is using traffic shaping to deliberately divert U.S. traffic to foreign soil. Indeed, there also has been no public discussion of whether the NSA believes that it is even legal to use traffic shaping to redirect American Internet traffic abroad. In fact, it is unclear even how traffic shaping could be authorized under the NSA\u2019s current legal authorities. Nevertheless, the possibility exists, and so it would be valuable to review the several techniques that can be used for traffic shaping, and explore a possible interpretation of the law that suggests that their use could be regulated entirely by EO 12333.\nThe legal argument rests on several issues that have not been decided by the courts (at least not publicly). Nevertheless, the key takeaway point is that FISA is outdated. Because FISA is over three decades old, it is ambiguous about modern surveillance technologies like traffic shaping. There is therefore a possibility that the intelligence community could conclude that traffic shaping is not regulated by FISA. If that were case, then the ambiguities concerning what is legal or not would be settled entirely within the executive branch and the intelligence community, and any traffic shaping program would avoid the scrutiny of the FISA Court.\nTraffic Shaping by \u201cPort Mirroring\u201d at Hacked Routers\nIt has been reported that the NSA already employs a technique to \u201cshape\u201d traffic so that it travels through a tapped communication cable. The traffic-shaping technique involves hacking into an Internet infrastructure device, for example, a router . A router is a device that forwards Internet traffic to its destination. 73 In Figure 3, which was hand-drawn by a hacker employed by the NSA and later leaked , the hacked device 74 is called a \u201c CNE midpoint .\u201d 75\nThe NSA likely does not read, analyze, collect, or store traffic at a hacked router\u2014routers are very limited devices that typically can only pass traffic along. Instead, the router is\u00a0simply instructed the router to copy the traffic and pass it along to a tapped communication cable where the actual eavesdropping occurs. 76 The original traffic still travels on its usual path to the destination. However, the traffic is additionally copied and passed on to an additional destination determined by the NSA. Network engineers call this process \u201c port mirroring .\u201d 77\nFigure 3\nNSA Diagram on Traffic Shaping. \u00a0Source: Peter Maass, \u201cTHE HUNTER: He Was a Hacker for the NSA and He Was Willing to Talk. I Was Willing to Listen,\u201d The Intercept , June 28, 2016.\nIt is important to remember that the router being hacked is not a personal communications device. A router is just a waypoint on the Internet infrastructure that forwards traffic aggregated from multiple sources. Because traffic from many individuals is aggregated at a single router, one could easily argue that hacking into a router does not \u201cintentionally target a U.S. person.\u201d 78\nFurthermore, traffic shaping via port mirroring is untargeted by its very nature. Because a router is a device with very limited capability, it is usually impossible to instruct the router to \u201cport mirror\u201d only a specific email or chat log toward a collection point. 79 Instead, port mirroring is more likely to redirect traffic to or from an entire website, company, or ISP. In fact, the same NSA employee that created Figure 3 also describes using traffic shaping to redirect the communications of the entire country of Yemen toward an NSA collection point. 80\nCan Routers Lawfully Be Hacked to Shape Traffic on U.S. Soil?\nWhile it is technically possible to redirect U.S. Internet traffic to foreign territory by hacking into routers, is it legal? What laws would govern this? In general, the legal framework surrounding hacking by intelligence agencies is murky, mostly because of classification, but also because FISA and EO 12333 were written three decades ago, before hacking became an essential part of surveillance operations.\nDoes FISA regulate hacking into a U.S. router and instructing it to perform traffic shaping by \u201cport mirroring\u201d traffic? If such an operation were regulated by FISA, then it would be subjected to the scrutiny of the FISA Court. As mentioned earlier, FISA is intended to be the \u201cexclusive means\u201d by which agencies were authorized to perform \u201celectronic surveillance.\u201d \u201cElectronic surveillance\u201d is a legal term that is defined the FISA statute; in fact, despite several amendments, FISA\u2019s definition of \u201celectronic surveillance\u201d remains largely unchanged from its original 1978 version. The FISA definition of \u201celectronic surveillance\u201d has two clauses that could be potentially cover hacking into a U.S. router and instructing it to perform traffic shaping via port-mirroring.\nOne clause in the FISA statute defines \u201celectronic surveillance\u201d to be\nthe installation or use of an electronic, mechanical, or other surveillance device in the United States for monitoring to acquire information, other than from a wire or radio communication, under circumstances in which a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy and a warrant would be required for law enforcement purposes. 81\nIn other words, this clause covers the installation of a device in the United States for surveillance. Hacking a U.S. router could certainly be considered the installation of a device. However, a router is a \u201cwireline\u201d device, and this clause does not cover devices that acquire information from a \u201cwire.\u201d 82 As such, this clause is not relevant to the discussion.\nAnother clause in the FISA statute defines \u201celectronic surveillance\u201d as\nthe acquisition by an electronic, mechanical, or other surveillance device of the contents of any wire communication to or from a person in the United States, without the consent of any party thereto, if such acquisition occurs in the United States, but does not include the acquisition of those communications of computer trespassers that would be permissible under section 2511(2)(i) of title 18, United States Code. 83\nThis clause covers the \u201cacquisition\u201d of communications inside the United States. However, one could argue that communications are not \u201cacquired\u201d when a U.S. router is hacked and instructed to perform port mirroring. The hacked router is merely instructed to copy traffic and pass it along, but not to read, store, or analyze it. Therefore, \u201cacquisition\u201d occurs at the tapped communication cable (abroad) rather than at the hacked router (inside the United States). As such, this clause is also not relevant. 84\nThese definitions suggest that hacking into domestic routers and using them for traffic shaping does not constitute \u201celectronic surveillance\u201d under FISA. But there are two more issues to consider before deciding that these activities do not fall under FISA.\nFirst, FISA\u2019s exclusivity clause states that FISA\u2019s \u201cprocedures . . . shall be exclusive means by which electronic surveillance . . . may be conducted.\u201d 85 Reiterating, \u201celectronic surveillance\u201d is a legal term that is narrowly defined by the FISA statute. Thus, one could argue that FISA forbids any traffic shaping program whose sole purpose is to circumvent the intentions of Congress when defining \u201celectronic surveillance\u201d in the FISA statute. That said, there is a simple way around this issue. If one could construct a different operational purpose for a traffic shaping program, then one would be on more solid ground. For instance, traffic shaping could be used \u201ctarget\u201d foreign communications, 86 or to run more traffic past a collection point that has special technical capabilities, and so on.\nIf FISA does not cover hacking into a U.S. router and instructing it to perform traffic shaping, then one must consider whether it is covered by the Constitution. Does hacking into router on U.S. soil constitute a \u201csearch\u201d or \u201cseizure\u201d under the Fourth Amendment? There are strong arguments that the answers to these questions would be yes, 87 but the courts have yet to conclusively address them . 88\nHowever, even if this traffic-shaping technique constitutes a Fourth Amendment \u201csearch\u201d or \u201cseizure,\u201d a warrant still may not be required. For instance, it may fall under a national security exception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement. 89 One might also consider the third-party doctrine, which holds that when users disclose information (such as Internet traffic) to a third party (such as Internet service providers), they have \u201c no reasonable expectation of privacy ,\u201d 90 and thus no warrant is required to search it. However, it is not clear how the third-party doctrine might apply in this setting. 91 So, while it may seem like a warrant should be required when hacking into a router and instructing it to perform port-mirroring, this warrant requirement may also be obviated by national-security or third-party-doctrine exceptions.\nSettling these complex legal questions is beyond the scope of this report, however. The main point is that a warrant might not be required for this traffic shaping technique. What would the intelligence community\u2019s lawyers do if they were asked to authorize a traffic-shaping program that redirects American traffic from U.S. territory to abroad? We don\u2019t know. However, there is a risk that they could conclude it falls exclusively within the purview of EO 12333. In this case, the traffic-shaping program would never be vetted by the FISA Court, and instead would be regulated entirely by a classified process that is internal to the executive branch.\nTraffic Shaping from Abroad\nEven if the legal framework somehow forbids authorities from hacking into routers located on U.S. soil, other traffic shaping techniques can be performed entirely from abroad. One such technique takes advantage of a network protocol called the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to trick neighboring networks into redirecting their traffic. 92\nBGP is an Internet protocol that allows routers to decide how to send Internet traffic across the web of connections that makes up the modern Internet. Routers continuously send each other BGP messages, updating each other about routes they have available through the Internet. To perform traffic shaping with BGP, an entity manipulates the BGP messages sent by one router to its neighboring routers, tricking these routers into redirecting their Internet traffic via a new route.\nThere have been many documented cases of deliberate BGP manipulations . 93\nFigure 4 shows one incident that took place in July 2013, where an Icelandic router caused traffic sent between two U.S. endpoints to be redirected through Iceland . 94 The Icelandic router sent a manipulated BGP message to a neighboring router in London, indicating that traffic destined for a group of American IP addresses should be routed to Iceland. The router in London was then convinced that traffic destined for these IP addresses should be routed to Iceland, rather than to the United States. The router in London then passed this manipulated BGP message to its neighbors, and so on, until the message eventually arrived at several routers in the United States.\nFigure 4\nSource: Andrea Peterson, \u201cResearchers say U.S. Internet traffic was re-routed through Belarus. That\u2019s a problem,\u201d Washington Post , November 20, 2013.\nThe results of the BGP manipulation, shown in Figure 4, indicate just how convoluted Internet routing can become. Traffic originating in Denver (which was destined for one the American IP addresses that was the original subject of the BGP manipulation) is first sent through several American cities before going to London and then to Reykjavik. From there, the traffic travels to Montreal before it finally reaches one of the American IP addresses (in Denver) that is the original subject of the BGP manipulation.\nIt is still unclear who was behind this incident. There is no reason to believe that it involved the U.S intelligence community. Nevertheless, it is possible that routers in the Icelandic network were hacked by some unknown party, and then instructed to send manipulated BGP messages, thus causing the chain of events shown in Figure 4.\nThis traffic-shaping technique can be performed entirely from abroad. In this incident, the Icelandic router needed only to send a single BGP message to its neighbor in London to get the ball rolling.\nOne could also argue that the technique is untargeted, because the manipulated BGP messages specified that traffic destined for a group of American IP addresses should be routed through Iceland, without singling out anyone or anything in particular. An IP address identifies computing devices on the Internet , and a single IP address can be used by multiple devices or people. 95 Moreover, BGP manipulations necessarily affect a group of IP addresses; it is generally not possible to perform a BGP manipulation that affects only a single IP address. Therefore, one could conclude can that BGP manipulation does not \u201cintentionally target\u201d a specific individual. 96\nAs the Icelandic incident shows, BGP can be manipulated to shape traffic from inside the United States to a tapped communication cable located abroad. And since the BGP manipulation is just tricking routers into moving traffic around, and is not storing, reading, or analyzing said traffic, it is not \u201cacquiring\u201d it. Instead, \u201cacquisition\u201d happens at the tapped foreign communication cable. As such, the same legal argument used before\u2014that this manipulation falls under EO 12333 rather than FISA\u2014would also apply here. But now, there are even fewer constitutional questions, since the router performing the initial BGP manipulation belongs to a foreign company and is located on foreign soil . 97\nBGP is not the only Internet protocol that can be manipulated to perform traffic shaping. For instance, rather than manipulating BGP, one could instead manipulate a routing protocol called Open Shortest Path First (OSPF). 98 Techniques for traffic shaping using OSPF have been described in a 2011 research paper by an NSA research scientist. 99\nTraffic Shaping by Consent\nThe intelligence community does not have to hack into routers or use other clandestine techniques to shape traffic\u2014it could simply ask the corporations that own those routers to provide access, or shape the traffic themselves. A document leaked by Edward Snowden suggests that the NSA has done this through its FAIRVIEW program. ( FAIRVIEW was revealed to be a code name for AT&T 100 ). The document states :\nFAIRVIEW\u2014Corp partner since 1985 with access to int[ernational] cables, routers, and switches. The partner operates in the U.S., but has access to information that transits the nation and through its corporate relationships provide unique access to other telecoms and ISPs. Aggressively involved in shaping traffic to run signals of interest past our monitors. 101\nThere is no evidence that the FAIRVIEW program is being used to shape traffic from inside the United States to foreign communications cables. But it is worth noting that, with the cooperation of corporations such as AT&T, traffic could easily be shaped to a collection point abroad without the need to hack into any routers, thus obviating many of the legal questions previously discussed.\nDoes All the Evidence Add Up to Traffic Shaping to Circumvent FISA?\nThis report has presented evidence that there is a possibility that the intelligence community can\u00a0traffic shaping methods to reduce the privacy protections that U.S. persons have for their communications under FISA.\nModern networking protocols and technologies can be manipulated in order to shape Internet traffic from inside the United States toward tapped communications cables located abroad. It is possible that traffic shaping is regulated by EO 12333, and not by FISA, 102 since the techniques shape traffic in bulk, in a way that does not \u201cintentionally target\u201d any specific individual or organization. Moreover, while FISA covers the \u201cacquisition\u201d of Internet traffic on U.S. territory, but the traffic shaping methods discussed merely move traffic around, but do not read, store, analyze, or otherwise \u201cacquire\u201d it. Instead, acquisition is performed on foreign soil, at the tapped communication cable. Finally, while the Fourth Amendment may require a warrant for hacking U.S. routers, the warrant requirement could be avoided by performing traffic shaping with the consent of corporations that own the routers (e.g. via the FAIRVIEW program), or by hacking foreign routers (and then using BGP manipulations).\nAs a final thought experiment, suppose that Congress decided not to reauthorize Section 702 of FISA, when it comes up for renewal at the end of this year. In this case, the NSA could no longer conduct warrantless surveillance on U.S. territory, and would instead have to revert to obtaining individualized FISA warrants 103 for collection on targets on U.S. soil. The additional burden of oversight could create a new and powerful incentive for the NSA to employ traffic-shaping programs within U.S. borders. Internet traffic could be \u201cshaped\u201d from within U.S. territory (where warrantless surveillance would not be lawful) to foreign territory, where it could be collected without a warrant under EO 12333.\nSo, the question remains, can the NSA lawfully employ traffic-shaping techniques as a loophole that evades privacy protections for U.S. persons? The answer to this question is probably buried in classified documents. Nevertheless, a loophole exists, and eliminating it calls for a realignment of current U.S. surveillance laws and policies.\nHow to Provide Oversight When Conducting Surveillance of Americans\nHow can we eliminate the loophole that allows the surveillance of American Internet communications to evade authorization from the FISA Court, the legislative branch, and judicial branch of the U.S. government?\nTechnical Solutions Will Not Work\nOne might be tempted to eliminate these loopholes via technical solutions. For instance, traffic shaping could be made more difficult by designing routers that are \u201cunhackable,\u201d and Internet protocols could be made secure against traffic-shaping manipulations. Or the confidentiality of traffic could be protected just by encrypting everything.\nWhile this approach sounds good in theory, in practice it is unlikely to work.\nFirst, it is highly unlikely that we will ever have Internet infrastructure devices (e.g. routers) that cannot be hacked. Router software is complicated, and even the best attempt at an \u201cunhackable\u201d router is likely to contain bugs . 104 Intelligence agencies have dedicated resources to finding and using these bugs to hack into routers. 105 And even if we somehow manage to create bug-free router software, the intelligence community has been known to physically intercept routers as they ship in the mail, and tamper with their hardware . 106\nA key challenge is that the Internet is a global system, one that transcends organizational and national boundaries.\nSecond, it will take many years to develop and implement secure Internet protocols that prevent traffic shaping. A key challenge is that the Internet is a global system, one that transcends organizational and national boundaries. Deploying a secure Internet protocol requires cooperation from thousands of independent organizations in different nations. This is further complicated by the fact that many secure Internet protocols do not work well when they are used only by a small number of networks. 107\nFinally, while encryption can be used to hide the contents of Internet traffic, it does not hide metadata (that is, who is talking to whom, when they are talking, and for how long). Metadata is both incredibly revealing, and less protected by the law. 108 Intelligence agencies have also dedicated resources toward compromising encryption . 109 Moreover, EO 12333 allows the NSA to retain encrypted communications indefinitely. 110 This is significant because the technology used to break encryption tends to improve over time\u2014a message that was encrypted in the past could be decryptable in the future, as technology improves. 111\nThis is not to say that technical solutions are unimportant. On the contrary, they are crucial, especially because they protect American\u2019s traffic from snoopers, criminals, foreign intelligence services, and other entities that do not obey American laws. Nevertheless, technologies evolve at a rapid pace, so solving the problem using technology would be a continuous struggle.\nIt is much more sensible to realign the legal framework governing surveillance to encompass the technologies, capabilities, and practices of today and of the future.\nA Legal Band-Aid Solution\nA band-aid solution would be to ensure that it is illegal to deliberately reroute the traffic of any and all traffic belonging U.S. persons to foreign soil, where it can be \u201cincidentally collected\u201d under EO 12333. A good start would be to clarify the laws and policies surrounding traffic shaping and hacking under FISA and EO 12333. This could have been addressed, for example, in the investigation of EO 12333 by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, first announced in July 2014. 112 However, the board\u2019s report still has not been completed, and the board has lost four of its required five member s. 113\nThe 1978 FISA definition of \u201cinstalling a device\u201d could also be revised in a technology-neutral fashion, so that it would forbid any rerouting of U.S. persons\u2019 communications, regardless of type of device. As this report has shown, many traffic shaping techniques cannot be executed in a \u201ctargeted\u201d fashion, so the practice should be ruled out entirely, even if Americans are not \u201cintentionally targeted.\u201d\nThis band-aid solution could rule out the use of traffic shaping to evade FISA by deliberately redirecting American traffic to foreign territory. However, this is highly unsatisfying, because this band-aid solution does not offer any protections for American traffic that naturally flows abroad. Indeed, this is a crucial issue, since we already know of at least one program that has swept up communications (including those of Americans) that was naturally routed to data centers on foreign territory. 114\nBreaking Down Territorial Boundaries in the Law: Expand FISA\nTherefore, the most natural solution would be to break down the legal barriers that separate spying abroad from spying on U.S. soil. The same legal framework should be applied to any and all Internet traffic, regardless of the geographical point of interception. This would disentangle Fourth Amendment protections for U.S. persons from the vagaries of Internet protocols and technologies. It would also offer robust legal protections as our communications technologies continue to evolve.\nIndeed, as mentioned earlier, the intelligence community has already acknowledged the importance of this issue. J. Michael McConnell, the director of national intelligence, justified expanded surveillance authorities under FISA by arguing in 2007 that today\u2019s \u201cglobal communications grid makes geography an increasingly irrelevant factor.\u201d 115 His argument for boundary free-surveillance is simple: if agents are surveilling only foreigners, why does it matter that the data collection happens on U.S. territory? Indeed, this boundary-free approach is becoming the norm for surveilling a foreign target. In 2016, for example , the government expanded its hacking authorities to allow a single warrant to be used to hack into a device, even if the physical location of the device is unknown. 116\nBut, likewise, this same logic should apply to expanding privacy protections for Americans, when their communications venture onto foreign soil. The argument remains simple: if agents end up collecting data on U.S. persons, why should those U.S. persons lose their judicially-protected right to privacy, just because the data was collected abroad? If geography is \u201can increasingly irrelevant factor,\u201d it should not the basis for Americans to lose their constitutional rights.\nOne concrete improvement would be that surveillance that affects Americans could no longer evade the scrutiny of the FISA Court.\nThe most thorough, satisfying solution would simply be to expand FISA to cover the collection of all traffic, both at home and abroad. While FISA\u2019s protections for U.S. persons are not perfect , 117 expanding FISA would still improve the current state of affairs. One concrete improvement would be that surveillance that affects Americans could no longer evade the scrutiny of the FISA Court. Furthermore, violations of the law would come with criminal penalties, rather than just sanctions internal to the intelligence community.\nTo enact this solution, Congress could revise FISA\u2019s definition of \u201celectronic surveillance,\u201d which determines the type of surveillance covered by FISA. The first goal of a revision would be to eliminate distinctions based on geographical location of collection. In other words, \u201celectronic surveillance\u201d should include data collected on both foreign and domestic territory. The second goal would be to formulate the definition in a technology-neutral fashion, so it cannot be outpaced by new technologies and new surveillance capabilities. (FISA\u2019s current definition of \u201celectronic surveillance\u201d is far from technology-neutral; it distinguishes, for example, between \u201cwired\u201d communications and \u201cradio\u201d communications. Moreover, it seems to exclude traffic shaping technologies, which is not especially surprising, since Congress could hardly be expected in 1978 to anticipate today\u2019s surveillance techniques.) A third goal would be to clarify and broaden the definition of \u201cintentional targeting.\u201d As we have seen, surveillance operations can still have significant impact on Americans even when they are not the \u201cintentional targets\u201d of the operation. 118\nThe FISA Amendments Act is set to expire in December 2017. Congress should not miss this opportunity to consider revising FISA\u2019s definition of \u201celectronic surveillance\u201d in order to eliminate loopholes that allow the executive branch to unilaterally conduct surveillance of American Internet traffic. Undertaking this revision is a crucial step toward ensuring that legislative and judiciary branches have a firm hand at protecting the privacy of American communications.\nAcknowledgements\nI thank Axel Arnbak for collaboration on the original research on which this article is based, 119 and the Sloan Foundation for funding that work.

This NSA hacker is the same person who also drew Figure 3 of this report, which will be discussed in detail later.\nPrograms under EO 12333 are not authorized by Congress, and thus not subject to statutory limitations. That said, Congress is engaged in appropriating the funds that pay for EO 12333 surveillance programs, and thus engages in oversight to ensure that these funds are properly spent. But it is unclear to what extent this oversight is concerned with Americans\u2019 privacy rights. In August 2013, for instance, the chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Diane Feinstein, stated: \u201cI don\u2019t think privacy protections are built into [EO 12333]. It\u2019s an executive policy. The executive controls intelligence in the country.\u201d She also said that \u201cThe other programs do not (have the same oversight as FISA). And that\u2019s what we need to take a look at,\u201d adding that her committee has not been able to \u201csufficiently\u201d oversee the programs run under the executive order. \u201cTwelve-triple-three programs are under the executive branch entirely.\u201d Ali Watkins, \u201cMost of NSA\u2019s data collection authorized by order Ronald Reagan issued,\u201d McClatchy, November 21, 2013, http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/national-security/article24759289.html . Feinstein has also stated, \u201cBy law, the Intelligence Committee receives roughly a dozen reports every year on FISA activities, which include information about compliance issues. Some of these reports provide independent analysis by the offices of the inspectors general in the intelligence community. The committee does not receive the same number of official reports on other NSA surveillance activities directed abroad that are conducted pursuant to legal authorities outside of FISA (specifically Executive Order 12333), but I intend to add to the committee\u2019s focus on those activities.\u201d From \u201cFeinstein Statement on NSA Compliance,\u201d August 16, 2013, https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2013/8/feinstein-statement-on-nsa-compliance .\n18 U.S. Code \u00a7 2516, \u201cAuthorization for interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications.\u201d\nU.S. Code 50, \u00a7\u00a7 1801 to 1813, https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/chapter-36/subchapter-I . FISA covers \u201cdomestic\u201d surveillance of the communications sent between Americans, when those communications are collected on U.S. soil. FISA also covers collection on U.S. soil when one \u201ccommunicant\u201d is a U.S. person and another \u201ccommunicant\u201d is a foreigner. (This might be called \u201ctransnational\u201d surveillance, rather than \u201cdomestic\u201d surveillance.) But, if that same transnational communication is collected abroad (without \u201cintentionally targeting a U.S. person\u201d), it is covered by EO 12333, not FISA. It\u2019s not completely clear whether FISA applies if the foreign end of the transnational communication is a foreign computer rather than a foreign person, and this report does not answer this question. Moreover, FISA\u2019s purview for stored communications and radio communications is different from its purview for wired communications. This report sidesteps all these issues. For analysis of the latter issue, see the Annex of Amos Toh, Faiza Patel, and Elizabeth Goitein, \u201cOverseas Surveillance in an Interconnected World,\u201d Brennan Center for Justice, March 16, 2016, https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/publications/Overseas_Surveillance_in_an_Interconnected_World.pdf which has a detailed breakdown of what falls under FISA and what falls under EO 12333.\nExecutive Order 12333 (1981)\u2014As amended by Executive Orders 13284 (2003), 13355 (2004), and 13470 (2008), https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/laws/executive-order-12333-1981-amended-executive-orders-13284-2003-13355-2004-and-13470-2008 .\nThe process of deciding what falls under FISA and what falls under EO 12333 is extremely complex, and often obscured by classification. We do not even attempt to describe it here. To get an idea of the complexity of this issue, see again the Annex in Toh, Patel, and Goitein, \u201cOverseas Surveillance in an Interconnected World,\u201d which has a detailed breakdown of what falls under FISA and what falls under EO 12333.\nSee discussion in note 11.\nThere are several reasons why the EO 12333 framework is more permissive than the FISA framework. FISA programs are authorized by all three branches of government, while EO 12333 programs are solely under the executive. Programs under FISA can be subject to review by the FISA court, while EO 12333 programs are not reviewed by any court. FISA can be challenged in court, because notice is required when evidence is obtained from FISA surveillance. Meanwhile, no statute requires notice of EO 12333 surveillance. See Toh, Patel, and Goitein, \u201cOverseas Surveillance in an Interconnected World\u201d; see also Zachary D. Clopton, \u201cTerritoriality, Technology, and National Security,\u201d University of Chicago Law Review 83, no. 1 (2015): 45\u201363, http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/uclrev/vol83/iss1/3 . Moreover, FISA requires a warrant when \u201cintentionally targeting a U.S. person.\u201d By contrast, under EO 12333, \u201cUS Person information may be collected, retained, or disseminated if consistent with the element\u2019s mission; consistent with an authorized category of collection; and permissible under the element\u2019s AG-approved guidelines.\u201d This quote is from a training module, where \u201celement\u201d refers to an element of the intelligence community, such as the CIA, the NSA, the FBI, and so on. See \u201cUse and Protection of US Person Information in US Intelligence Community Activities,\u201d Office of the Director of National Intelligence, https://www.aclu.org/foia-document/use-and-protection-us-person-information-us-intelligence-community-activities . The NSA\u2019s procedures under EO 12333 also contain four full pages of exceptions that allow U.S. persons to be intentionally targeted without a warrant. One exception allows the U.S. attorney general to approve targeting of a U.S. person subject to the constraint that it collects \u201csignificant foreign intelligence\u201d\u2014broadly defined to include information \u201crelating to the capabilities, intentions and activities\u201d of \u201cforeign persons.\u201d See Toh, Patel, and Goitein, \u201cOverseas Surveillance in an Interconnected World\u201d; see also Axel Arnbak and Sharon Goldberg, \u201cLoopholes for Circumventing the Constitution: Unrestrained Bulk Surveillance on Americans by Collecting Network Traffic Abroad,\u201d Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review 21, no. 2 (2015): 317\u2013361, http://repository.law.umich.edu/mttlr/vol21/iss2/3 . Finally, dissemination of information collected under EO 12333 is also less restrained; see again Toh, Patel, and Goitein, \u201cOverseas Surveillance in an Interconnected World.\u201d\nActually, it is debatable whether a FISA Title I court order is \u201ca warrant in the constitutional sense.\u201d What matters for this report, however, is that these court orders are issued by an independent court staffed by federal district judges appointed by the chief justice of the United States, rather than by processes internal to the intelligence community and the executive branch.

The USA Freedom Act, H.R. 2048, June 2, 2015, https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2048/text . Generally speaking, it governs surveillance of Americans on U.S. soil.

An amusing example comes from the Defense Intelligence Agency\u2019s Intelligence Law Handbook from 2004, whose chapter \u201cCollection of Information about United States Persons\u201d opens like this: \u201cTo begin the journey, it is necessary to stop first and adjust your vocabulary. The terms and words used in DoD 5240.1-R have very specific meanings, and it is often the case that one can be led astray by relying on the generic or commonly understood definitions of a particular word.\u201d (DoD 5240.1-R is a Department of Defense directive that falls under EO 12333.) According to the Intelligence Law Handbook, \u201cfor the purposes of DoD 5240.1-R, information is \u2018collected\u2019 only when it has been received for use by an employee of a DoD intelligence component in the course of his official duties . . . (and) an employee takes some affirmative action that demonstrates an intent to use or retain the information. So, we see that \u2018collection of information\u2019 for DoD 5240.1-R purposes is more than \u2018gathering\u2019\u2014it could be described as \u2018gathering, plus. . . .\u2019 For the purposes of DoD 5240.1-R, \u2018collection\u2019 is officially gathering or receiving information, plus an affirmative act in the direction of use or retention of that information.\u201d Intelligence Law Handbook, Defense Intelligence Agency, August 2004, https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/eo12333/DIA/Intelligence%20Law%20Handbook%20Defense%20HUMINT%20Service.pdf , 3\u20135. The interpretation of collection has recently been updated by the Department of Defense as follows: \u201cInformation is collected when it is received by a Defense Intelligence Component, whether or not it is retained by the Component for intelligence or other purposes. Collected information includes information obtained or acquired by any means, including information that is volunteered to the Component. Collected information does not include: Information that only momentarily passes through a computer system of the Component; Information on the Internet or in an electronic forum or repository outside the Component that is simply viewed or accessed by a Component employee but is not copied, saved, supplemented, or used in some manner; Information disseminated by other Components or elements of the Intelligence Community; or Information that is maintained on behalf of another U.S. Government agency and to which the Component does not have access for intelligence purposes.\u201d Again, information is not \u201ccollected\u201d if it is not \u201ccopied, saved, supplemented, or used in some manner.\u201d See \u201cProcedures Governing the Conduct of DOD Intelligence Activities,\u201d DOD Manual 5240.01, U.S. Department of Defense, August 8, 2016, http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/524001m.pdf .\nIn October 2013, Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) explained this as follows: \u201cThirty-five years ago, different countries had their own telecommunications infrastructure, so the division between foreign and domestic collection was clear. Today there\u2019s a global communications infrastructure, so there\u2019s a greater risk of collecting on Americans when the NSA collects overseas.\u201d From Barton Gellman, Julie Tate, and Ashkan Soltani, \u201cIn NSA-intercepted Data, Those Not Targeted Far Outnumber the Foreigners Who Are,\u201d Washington Post, July 5, 2014, http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/in-nsa-intercepted-data-those-not-targeted-far-outnumber-the-foreigners-who-are/2014/07/05/8139adf8-045a-11e4-8572-4b1b969b6322_story.html.\nSee discussion in note 13.\nActually, this holds for \u201cwire\u201d communications (for example, Internet communications) and \u201cstored\u201d communications.

This was because the NSA was sweeping up purely domestic emails\u2014emails where the sender and all recipients were American\u2014without a warrant. In 2013, Senator Ron Wyden explained the issue as follows: \u201cThe ruling states that the NSA has knowingly acquired tens of thousands of wholly domestic communications under section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, even though this law was specifically written to prohibit the warrantless acquisition of wholly domestic communications. The FISA Court has noted that this collection violates the spirit of the law. . . .\u201d Spencer Ackerman, \u201cNSA illegally collected thousands of emails before Fisa court halted program,\u201d Guardian, August 21, 2013, https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/21/nsa-illegally-collected-thousands-emails-court .\nThe FISA Court opinion is available here: https://lawfare.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/staging/s3fs-public/uploads/2013/08/162016974-FISA-court-opinion-with-exemptions.pdf .\nCharlie Savage, \u201cReagan-Era Order on Surveillance Violates Rights, Says Departing Aide,\u201d New York Times, August 13, 2014, http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/14/us/politics/reagan-era-order-on-surveillance-violates-rights-says-departing-aide.html?_r=0 .\nMetadata typically receives a less legal protection than content due to a decision made in Smith v.

The element will provide a copy of this report to NSA\u2019s OGC, NSA\u2019s Civil Liberties and Privacy Office, the DNI\u2019s Civil Liberties Protection Officer, DoD\u2019s OGC, and the DoD Senior Intelligence Oversight Official (SIOO).\u201d From \u201cProcedures for the Availability or Dissemination of Raw Signals Intelligence Information by the National Security Agency under Section 2.3 of Executive Order 12333 (Raw SIGINT Availability Procedures),\u201d https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3283349/Raw-12333-surveillance-sharing-guidelines.pdf .\nFor more discussion see again Toh, Patel, and Goitein, \u201cOverseas Surveillance in an Interconnected World.\u201d\nA deeper discussion of this issue is available in C\u00e1sarez, \u201cThe Synergy of Privacy and Speech.\u201d Journal of Constitutional Law 18, no. 3 (February 2016): 814, http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1594&context=jcl .\nIn the following passage, the term BR (Business Records) or PR/TT (Pen Register/Trap and Trace) refers to data collected under FISA: \u201c(TS//SI//NF) (SV Character) However, as we\u2019ve discussed, not all BR or PR/TT results are unique. If a query result indicates it was derived from another collection source in addition to BR or PR/TT, the rules governing the other collection authority would apply to the handling and sharing of that query result. For example, this result came from both BR and E.O. 12333 collection; therefore, because it is not unique to BR information, it would be ok to inform non-BR cleared individuals of the fact of this communication, as well as task, query, and report this information according to standard E.O. 12333 guidelines.\u201d The quote in the body of the text replaces \u201dBR/TT\u201d with \u201cFISA\u201d for clarity.

The FLAG cable a very high capacity cable that connects the United States with the United Kingdom, the Mediterranean, India, and China. The FLAG cable was tapped by the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) on British soil, and the collected communications were shared with the NSA. Details of how the GCHQ tapped the FLAG cable were revealed by Geoff White, \u201cSpy Cable Revealed: How Telecoms Firm Worked With GCHQ,\u201d Channel 4, November 20, 2014, http://www.channel4.com/news/spy-cable-revealed-how-telecoms-firm-worked-with-gchq .

See \u201cNetwork Shaping 101,\u201d https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2919677-Network-Shaping-101.html .\nDevolving into network engineering parlance for the purpose of this note, the traffic is copied by port mirroring, and then likely encapsulated and forward to a destination IP address at one endpoint of the tapped cable. This type of port mirroring is natively supported by some high-end Cisco routers using a feature called ERSPAN. \u201c[ERSPAN] is IP-based packet capture format that can be used to transport exact copies of packets to a network probe to analyze and characterize the operational load and protocol distribution of a network as well as to detect anomalies such as network-based worms or viruses. This replication and transport mechanism operates over one or multiple switch or router ports whose traffic can be mirrored and forwarded to a destination device in charge of traffic analysis and reporting.\u201d M. Foschiano, \u201cCisco Systems\u2019 Encapsulated Remote Switch Port Analyzer (ERSPAN),\u201d Cisco Systems, January 2016, https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-foschiano-erspan-01 .

It\u2019s unclear whether the NSA is using native port-mirroring support in the routers that it hacks, or is adding support for port mirroring using a \u201cdorked operating system\u201d that it installs on the hacked router; see leaked NSA document at https://www.aclu.org/files/natsec/nsa/five-eyes-hacking-large-routers.pdf .\nOne might also argue that, if the router is owned by a U.S. corporation, then hacking into it constitutes \u201cintentionally targeting a U.S. person,\u201d because U.S. persons are defined to include U.S. corporations. This argument can be dismissed by arguing that the \u201ctarget\u201d of the surveillance operation is Internet traffic aggregated at the router, rather than the corporation that owns the router.\nThis would require deep-packet inspection (DPI), a capability that is generally not available inside a router.\nThe shaping the communications of the entire country of Yemen is described in \u201cNetwork Shaping 101.\u201d The connection between these slides and the NSA hacker who drew Figure 3 is described in Maass, \u201cThe Hunter.\u201d\nU.S. Code 50, \u00a7 1801 (f)(4).\nThe Congressional Research Service gives the installation of a hidden microphone as an example of surveillance that is covered by this clause. See Edward C. Liu, \u201cReauthorization of the FISA Amendments Act 7,\u201d Congressional Research Service R42725, April 8, 2013, 7, https://fas.org/sgp/crs/intel/R42725.pdf .\nU.S. Code 50, \u00a7 1801 (f)(2).\nOne might alternatively argue that is clause is relevant, because instructing a router under your control to copy traffic does constitute \u201cacquisition.\u201d This is debatable. (Personally, this author disagrees with this interpretation.) Nevertheless, the high-level point still stands either way: FISA is outdated and ambiguous. There is a risk that the intelligence community\u2019s lawyers could come to the conclusion that this clause is irrelevant, and eventually conclude that traffic shaping falls entirely under EO 12333. In this case, the traffic shaping program will never be vetted by the FISA court and the ambiguities in the law will be settled entirely within the intelligence community.\nU.S. Code 50, \u00a7 1821, https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1812 .\nWe repeat the quote from John N. Tye: \u201cHypothetically, under 12333 the NSA could target a single foreigner abroad. And hypothetically if, while targeting that single person, they happened to collect every single Gmail and every single Facebook message on the company servers not just from the one person who is the target, but from everyone\u2014then the NSA could keep and use the data from those three billion other people. That\u2019s called \u2018incidental collection.\u2019\u201d See Farivar, \u201cIt\u2019s official\u2014NSA did keep its e-mail metadata program after it \u2018ended\u2019 in 2011.\u201d\nIn United States v. Jones, the Supreme Court ruled that a physical trespass is a \u201csearch.\u201d Hacking into a router certainly seems like a trespass, even though the trespass is not physical. United States v. Jones, 132 S.Ct. 945 (2012), https://www.oyez.org/cases/2011/10-1259 . Another issue to consider is whether instructing a hacked router to port mirror Internet traffic constitutes a seizure of that Internet traffic. Orin Kerr, professor at The George Washington University Law School, argues that \u201ccopying data \u2018seizes\u2019 it under the Fourth Amendment when copying occurs without human observation and interrupts the stream of its possession or transmission.\u201d This test implies that port-mirroring is a Fourth Amendment \u201cseizure\u201d\u2014the hacked router clearly copies Internet traffic that no human observed, and alters its stream of transmission by redirecting it to a different communication cable. See Orin Kerr, \u201cFourth Amendment Seizures of Computer Data,\u201d Yale Law Journal 119 (2010): 700, https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1378402 .\nStanford University Ph.D. Candidate Jonathan Mayer considers a similar question in the context of deploying malware as part of law enforcement, rather than national security, operations. He states: \u201cGovernment hacking forces a constitutional privacy reckoning. In its most common configuration, law enforcement malware selectively reports from a device, retrieving only data that is\u2014in isolation\u2014constitutionally unprotected [for instance, metadata]. A majority of courts have concluded that this type of hacking falls outside the Fourth Amendment\u2019s privacy protection. This Article respectfully posits that the courts are going astray. . . .\u201d Jonathan Mayer, \u201cConstitutional Malware,\u201d November 14, 2016, https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2633247 . Orin Kerr\u2019s test (mentioned in note 88) was used in the [redacted]@mac.com case to argue that the copying of email contents constitutes a Fourth Amendment seizure. \u201cIn the Matter of the Search of Information Associated with [Redacted]@Mac.Com That Is Stored at Premises Controlled by Apple, Inc.,\u201d 13 F.Supp.3d 145 (2014), https://leagle.com/decision/In%20FDCO%2020140505A61/MATTER%20OF%20SEARCH%20OF%20INFO%20WITH%20[REDACTED]@MAC.COM . However, per the discussion in Mayer\u2019s \u201cConstitutional Malware\u201d article, the author wonders how the courts would employ this test to the copying of metadata. Recall from earlier in this report, that EO 12333 gives the intelligence community significant latitude to algorithmically analyze metadata, even when that metadata belongs to Americans.\nSarah Fowler, \u201cCircumventing the Constitution for National Security: An Analysis of the Evolution of the Foreign Intelligence Exception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s Warrant Requirement,\u201d National Security and Armed Conflict Law Review 4 (2013): 207, http://repository.law.miami.edu/umnsac/vol4/iss1/6/ , or L.

Maryland, 442 U.S. 735 (1979), http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/442/735.html .\nIndeed, as Supreme Court Justice Sotomayor stated in her 2013 concurrence in United States v. Jones: \u201cMore fundamentally, it may be necessary to reconsider the premise that an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to third parties. This approach is ill suited to the digital age, in which people reveal a great deal of information about themselves to third parties in the course of carrying out mundane tasks . . . I would not assume that all information voluntarily disclosed to some member of the public for a limited purpose is, for that reason alone, disentitled to Fourth Amendment protection.\u201d\nThe NSA slides on traffic shaping discussed earlier specifically mentions the use of BGP manipulations. Quoting directly from the slides: \u201cYou could try to tweak BGP routing tables to make your 2 links the most attractive for inbound traffic. . . . That *could* work, but two bad things would result from this: 1- Its a pretty noisy thing to do on the Internet. People would notice bad BGP updates. 2- You would throttle all traffic through those two links, which Yemennet would probably notice.\u201d In other words, it seems like the NSA has the technical capability to perform BGP manipulations, but chooses not to do so because these manipulations might be detected. See \u201cNetwork Shaping 101,\u201d\nhttps://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2919677-Network-Shaping-101.html .\nFor an accessible background on BGP and BGP manipulations see Craig Timberg, \u201cThe Long Life of Quick Fix: Internet Protocol from 1989 Leaves Data Vulnerable to Hackers,\u201d Washington Post, December 16, 2012, http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/2015/05/31/net-of-insecurity-part-2/ . For a more technical treatment, see Sharon Goldberg, \u201cWhy Is It Taking So Long to Secure Internet Routing?\u201d acmqueue 12, no. 8 (September 11, 2014): 56\u201363, http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2668966 .\nAndrea Peterson, \u201cResearchers Say U.S. Internet Traffic Was Re-routed Through Belarus. That\u2019s a Problem,\u201d\nWashington Post, November 20, 2013, http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/11/20/researchers-say-u-s-internet-traffic-was-re-routed-through-belarus-thats-a-problem/?auto=format .\n\u201cWashington Court Rules that IP Addresses Are Not Personally Identifiable Information,\u201d Privacy and Information Security Law Blog, July 10, 2009, https://www.huntonprivacyblog.com/2009/07/10/washington-court-rules-that-ip-addresses-are-not-personally-identifiable-information/ .\nOne might still worry that the target of this manipulation is the \u201cU.S. person\u201d that holds this group of American IP addresses. (Note that the legal definition of \u201cU.S. person\u201d includes companies headquartered in the United States.) However, one could get around this by constructing a different operational purpose for the traffic shaping program. For instance, one could argue that the target is a foreigner that is communicating via a service hosted at the American IP addresses. One could imagine that a similar operational purpose could have been constructed as part of the operation that tapped the communication links between Google and Yahoo datacenters abroad, as cited in earlier in note 56. In fact, this seems to be exactly the scenario that John N. Tye outlined in the statement quoted earlier in note 87.\nIn the United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, the Supreme Court held that Fourth Amendment protections do not apply to a nonresident alien in a foreign country. See United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. 259 (1990), http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/494/259.html . Thus, one might argue that hacking into a foreign router does not require a warrant under the Fourth Amendment. One could also apply Orin Kerr\u2019s test (see discussion in note 88) to argue that BGP manipulation \u201cseizes\u201d data because it \u201cinterrupts the stream of its possession or transmission\u201d without \u201chuman observation.\u201d However, one might further argue that \u201cseizure\u201d occurred abroad (because the stream of \u201cpossession or transmission\u201d is interrupted by BGP manipulation that is conducted entirely on foreign soil) and therefore does not require a warrant under the Fourth Amendment.\nBGP is the routing protocol used between networks owned by different organizations; OSPF is the routing protocol used within a network owned by a single organization.\nOne research paper tackles an interesting technical problem: \u201cWe wish to reroute the shortest path between two nodes over a particular link (or node) while minimizing the number of other shortest paths that change.\u201d This is done by \u201cassigning or altering [OSPF] link weights.\u201d See W. Weyerman, B. Durtschi, and R.

Bhandari worked for the Laboratory for Telecommunications Sciences, Department of Defense (the NSA\u2019s research lab) at the time these research papers were written.\nSee Julia Angwin, Jeff Larson, Charlie Savage, James Risen, Henrik Moltke and Laura Poitras, \u201cNSA Spying Relies on AT&T\u2019s \u2018Extreme Willingness to Help,\u2019\u201d ProPublica and New York Times, August 15, 2015, https://www.propublica.org/article/nsa-spying-relies-on-atts-extreme-willingness-to-help .\nGlenn Greenwald, \u201cDocuments from No Place to Hide,\u201d http://hbpub.vo.llnwd.net/o16/video/olmk/holt/greenwald/NoPlaceToHide-Documents-Uncompressed.pdf .\nWhat if traffic-shaping does fall under FISA after all? In this case, the intelligence community might still be able to obtain judicial authorization, under FISA, for shaping traffic from inside the United States to foreign territory. (As noted earlier, avoiding FISA\u2019s \u201cexclusivity\u201d clause requires that the traffic shaping program have some operational purpose other than just circumventing FISA.) The U.S. traffic would then be shaped abroad, where it would be \u201cincidentally collected\u201d along with other foreign traffic from a tapped foreign communication cable. Because the traffic is incidentally collected on foreign soil, it could be handled according to the EO 12333 rules, rather than the FISA rules. This seems consistent with the revealed documents cited in note 67.\nSee discussion in note 18.\nSee the discussion of \u201cWhy Vulnerabilities Will Always Exist\u201d in Steven M.

One only needs to review the collateral damage (think, \u201chomeowners\u201d) that followed the 2008 subprime meltdown to see the devastation wrought to communities around the country and let\u2019s not forget those impacted were folk of all political leanings.\nBruce Jacobs, a Miami based lawyer and former state prosecutor, is riding point in a legal charge to make good use of \u201cunclean hands\u201d as a foreclosure defense and his arguments have begun to resonate with some Florida judges.\nOne of his cases \u2014 Wells Fargo v John Riley \u2014 was dismissed last December in a Palm Beach, Florida Circuit Court, after the Judge found plaintiffs had failed to scrub unclean hands; to wit: Wells Fargo and its servicer, JP Morgan Chase (both parties to the $25 billion National Mortgage Settlement) relied on false testimony and failed to explain how an endorsement from the original lender, Washington Mutual (remember them? The financial institution notable for being history\u2019s biggest bank failure) came to be affixed to the note years after WAMU went out of business. Finally, the court found that the \u201cpurported mortgage loan schedules\u201d was a phony; missing essential data (plaintiff\u2019s witness first claimed that this was done to protect the borrower\u2019s \u201cprivacy.\u201d The Judge forced the witness, upon cross-examination, to admit that it had nothing to do with privacy. It was simply missing).\nIt seemed that the plaintiffs had taken one too many Mulligans in trying to justify how Wells Fargo had obtained the mortgage and note which finally led the Judge to this conclusion:\nThe court finds Plaintiff failed to prove every element of its case by substantial competent evidence and has unclean hands, and enters judgement in favor of the Defendant, John Riley.\nIn short, the good guys \u2014 at least in this case \u2014 win.\nIn the arcane world of mortgage securitization, where tens of millions of loans are sliced, diced and parceled out to third party investors the process of proving who really owns a loan, and who has the legal standing to foreclose, is much like asking a medieval alchemist to give a step by step description \u2014 with verification \u2014 of how lead is turned to gold.\nWall Street\u2019s alchemists, flush with post-2008 bail-out money, devised grand schemes to by-pass long enshrined traditions of recording mortgage assignments with county clerks \u2014 time consuming and costly \u2014 for the easier route of simply creating their own paper and to hell with so-called \u201cchain of title\u201d (necessary to prove ownership of a mortgage). With a foreclosure Shangri-La looming \u2014 so many homes to seize and sell \u2014 scrubbing close to the law was a pesky irritation; better to employ an army of low-wage \u201crobo-signers\u201d trained to sign a name that wasn\u2019t theirs in front of friendly notaries who simply looked the other way and present these \u201caffidavits\u201d in evidence: so, damn the defendants and let\u2019s disgorge Daddy/Mommy/Kiddies/Pets (maybe Granny and Grandpa) with alacrity.\nSeveral years back I wrote about an ex-Federal prosecutor \u2014 Cynthia Kouril \u2014 and her outrage over the mass creation of on-demand phony paper created by DocX; a company highly sought after by bottom-feeding law firms (a/k/a \u201dforeclosure mills\u201d) for expertise in creating all sorts of foreclosure fiction which, in turn, provided many an uncritical judge with enough evidence to rule against protesting homeowners. With the mainstream press picking up on the story even Eric Holder\u2019s Wall Street-friendly Department of Justice had to send out head of the Criminal Division, Lanny Breuer, to force a prosecution of DocX CEO, Lorraine Brown. She was that very rare bird: a foreclosure industry lackey who actually spent hard time in the slammer and considering that Breuer was the guy who admitted, in a 2013 episode of PBS\u2019s Frontline, that he didn\u2019t want to go too hard on Wall Street for fear of causing executive job loss, you know that DocX had done something extraordinarily egregious.\nUnfortunately, as Bruce Jacobs and other lawyers of similar mind can attest to: this particular episode did not end the fraud.\nJust ask attorney, Linda Tirelli, who has kicked over many, many rocks to reveal fraudulent foreclosure documents in cases she\u2019s defended in Westchester County, New York. I\u2019ve asked her this question several times and repeated her Sherlock Holmes response in articles I\u2019ve written for American Banker and Huffington Post:\nI can dissect a bogus document in three minutes or less and find them in 98% of all cases\nUnclean hands, as a legal doctrine, injects a healthy dose of ethics into the courtroom and essentially hangs the notion that the end-justify-the-means on its own legal petard. It\u2019s astonishing to discover \u2014 as I did \u2014 that this nostrum is rooted in an 19th century United States Supreme Court decision which proclaimed that \u201cequitable powers can never be exerted in behalf of one who has acted fraudulently, or who, by deceit or any unfair means, has gained an advantage.\u201d (Bein v Heath, 1848)\nApril Charney, an attorney licensed in Florida and Arkansas, has seen much home snatching and it\u2019s the kind of thing that pisses her off to no end. First called to the bar in 1980 she immediately immersed herself in the thanklessly underfunded world of legal services representing poor people and then, in 1999, spinning off into representing poor people fighting foreclosure (she\u2019s handled hundreds of cases) and like Tirelli she\u2019s become expert in the \u201cput up\u201d (the proper documents) or \u201cshut up,\u201d and explain to the judge why fabricated documents are being filed in court. Her expertise in parsing the wording of such mortgage critical documents as PSA\u2019s (\u201dPooling and Servicing Agreements\u201d) and uncovering the finer points of assignment fraud earned her the title, \u201cThe Loan Ranger,\u201d in a 2009 New York Post article. Charney, who continues to work on foreclosure cases with lawyers around the country, can sometimes be found traveling in an RV \u2014 together with her husband, a retired legal aid lawyer \u2014 offering advice, on-line, from her mobile perch.\nI would be remiss if I didn\u2019t point out that one of the first jurists to take on the weighty challenge of providing legal truth to power \u2014 and giving support to the unclean hands notion \u2014 was the late Brooklyn State Supreme Court Judge Arthur Shack (sprung from this mortal coil well before his time). Despised by foreclosure mill lawyers for his integrity in holding fast to the letter and spirit of the law \u2014 throwing out most of the foreclosure cases he suspected were built on a foundation of fraud \u2014 his sentiments were captured in this quote I used for an RIP piece:\nI want to see the servicing agent\u2019s power of attorney. I want to see all the paperwork before I approve it... If the paperwork is garbage, I deny it. If you\u2019re going to take away someone\u2019s home, it should be done properly.\nBruce Jacobs, April Charney and Linda Tirelli all give major props to the lawyer they consider a mentor: O Max Gardner \u2014 founder of Bankruptcy Boot Camp \u2014 a 160 acre enclave nestled in the hills of North Carolina. Max is a legend, rightfully so, and since 2006 he\u2019s weaponized consumer attorneys with the skills necessary to dig deep into foreclosure filings and see what lies beneath. His formula is simple: become like the bankers and lawyers you do battle with; learn their tricks \u2014 the short cuts they take \u2014 the reasons why they succeed while many foreclosure defense lawyers don\u2019t. Then take this knowledge and do battle with those on Wall Street who\u2019ve made themselves rich while making Main Street house-poor. With a determination that rivals R Lee Ermey (in that classic opening scene in Full Metal Jacket) Gardner instills in his charges a veritable St. George\u2019s passion to slay the foreclosure dragons.\nMax offered me his vision of the work and a response to the oft-heard criticism that homeowners fighting foreclosure are simply deadbeats who want a \u201cfree house.\u201d\nReporters and judges have often asked me this question and I answer that it is better that some mortgage bankers lose their rights to recovery than it would be for any homeowner to lose a home due to dishonest, mistaken, inaccurate or even fraudulent evidence. This is the only incentive that we have to keep the bankers and mortgage servicers honest in their court cases. Is this fair or just? Damn right it is!\nBruce Jacobs has taken skills honed at Boot Camp and used them in good measure in HSBC v Buset, where Miami Dade Circuit Court Judge, Beatrice Butchko, dismissed a foreclosure case against his client. Her decision is peppered with through-the looking-class legal sentiments when discussing the servicer \u2014 Ocwen \u2014 and the evidence they brought to court. Selected sub-section headings: A Specific Endorsement and Assignment of Mortgage that Both Reflect a Transaction that Never Happened. In referencing the problem-ridden mortgage servicing platform that Ocwen relies on \u2014 known as REALServicing \u2014 Judge Butchko pens a heading that is unmistakable in its sarcasm: The Legal Fiction That Ocwen\u2019s Loan Boarding Process In This Case Verifies the Accuracy, Reliability of Correctness of the Prior Servicer\u2019s Records. Judge Butchko also found (as in Riley) that plaintiffs relied on false testimony to try and create evidence of standing and violated a court order that made their \u201cunclean hands\u201d obvious.\nThe Buset case is currently on appeal in Florida\u2019s Third District Court of Appeals and I\u2019ll leave it to Jacobs to offer some parting sentiments.\nThe Riley and Buset decisions were David v. Goliath battles that fell perfectly into place. I have faith that the Third District Court of Appeals will see the pattern in both the Riley and Buset decisions and decide now is the time to vindicate the integrity of the courts. The doctrine of unclean hands is not enough. Courts have inherent contempt powers to deal with parties to the National Mortgage Settlement who still disobey court orders, present false testimony, and rely on false evidence in equitable actions. It would be patriotic and greatly strengthen our democracy to impose sanctions that holds these most powerful banks accountable. Can I get an amen?\nYes, Amen!",

        "text": "Gesaka Chacha stands out in a group of women and young men assembled at a chief's camp in Maeta Village in Kuria East, Migori County.\nGesaka Chacha stands out in a group of women and young men assembled at a chief's camp in Maeta Village in Kuria East, Migori County. He is the only elderly man in a group discussing female genital mutilation (FGM).\nWhen he stands to address the villagers who are listening to radio programmes on female genital mutilation, he is received by an attentive audience. Without shame, the 74-year-old speaks about a taboo topic.\n\"It takes a strong-willed person to change the tune on ingrained cultural practices such as FGM. I have elected to be that person,\" says Mzee Chacha.\nSince March last year, Maeta Village has been part of community radio talk shows produced by the Association of Media Women in Kenya, with support from the Girl Generation. The programmes allow the community to discuss FGM openly.\nMzee Chacha's presence in the group was not without resistance, but he defied calls from his fellow elders to stand by the female cut.\nMzee Chacha worked in Nairobi until his retirement, an experience that exposed him to the benefits of educating girls. That may sound like a no-brainer, until you look at the data and the implications educating girls has for FGM.\nStatistics show that the more educated a woman is, the less likely she is to be cut. Moreover, shortly after the cut, girls get married (early).\nWhile in Nairobi, Mzee Chacha, who is now a farmer, educated all his daughters and became a vocal campaigner against FGM and child marriage. This has often put him at loggerheads with his fellow elders, for violating cultural norms.\n\"When I began my campaign, they wondered how a man of my age would talk ill of our traditional practices. They even said I am bewitched,\" he says.\nHaving lived in Kisumu, Mombasa and Nairobi, Mzee Chacha met women who had escaped genital mutilation as girls and gone on to become leaders in various offices. This inspired him to push his own daughters skip the cut and early marriage and aim for the stars instead.\nA CHAMPION\n\"Mimi na boma yangu tumeamua kuuasi ukeketaji (My family has decided to say no to female circumcision),\" says the father of six, who is now a champion for girls' rights.\n\"I have also been telling men to have their sons circumcised at a health facility for the sake of their own health. But they believe that unless one has been cut by a traditional circumciser according to the Kuria traditional practices, the circumcision is not meaningful,\" he says.\nFor the Kuria, the cut is more than just a surgical procedure; it is the rite of passage through which all girls must undergo to be ushered into womanhood.\nFGM preparations begin in August when boys and girls practise songs and dances ahead of the circumcision season in December. Many children lose out on school hours while others drop out in the four months of preparations.\nThis is the same time that Standard Eight and Form Four students are preparing for their national examinations.\n\"The practice negatively affects the preparedness of the candidates, some of whom have to devote their time to the circumcision ceremony rehearsals hence risking poor performance in their examinations,\" Mzee Chacha explains.\nThe biggest obstacle in fighting FGM is Mzee Chacha's peers. When he brought the antiFGM campaign to them in early 2016, they shunned him.\n\"But I did not fear. I soldiered on because change begins with one person, then the next and the next, and before long, the outlawed practice (FGM) will be eradicated,\" he affirms.\nHe has no illusions, though. He knows that cultural elders, and especially men, are key to eradicating FGM.\n\"Unajua wazee hapa ndio wanaleta shida (the men are the problem here),\" he says while calling upon the area chief to lead the war against FGM.\nIn one circumcision season more than 100 young girls undergo FGM in the area. Mzee Chacha's door-to-door campaign takes him to homes, schools and elders' gatherings talking about the dangers of FGM.\nHis school training sessions intensify in July ahead of the December circumcision season.\nBefore then, very day he sits with three to eight cultural elders, discussing ways to end FGM in the community.",

        "text": "Back in January, I wrote about the abysmal county health rankings in Deep East Texas and the fact that Angelina County has been named the county with the highest obesity rate in Texas. Almost four out of 10 of us aren\u2019t merely overweight, we are downright obese. Let\u2019s just admit it; we\u2019re fat. And that fatness is a major factor in the development of high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease and many cancers, among other illnesses.\nObesity is a double-edged sword that is both killing us early and costing us a lot in terms of ongoing health care expenditures and lost productivity. Smoking is, of course, another huge factor in our high cost of health care and poorer health outcomes. We must do better.\nThe rhetoric on the national stage is all about the skyrocketing cost of health insurance and how to tweak (or get rid of) Obamacare, as if that would solve our health care problems. The government can\u2019t do it for us, folks. Regardless of what happens with health care reform, we need to collectively get off our fat behinds and take more responsibility for our own health. We need to do this individually, yes, but we also need to work on this as a community.\nI mentioned in January the groundwork being laid by the Texas Forest Country Partnership. They hosted a series of strategic planning sessions to set goals for growth across a broad spectrum of our regional economy, from forestry and tourism to manufacturing and health care. Part of their health care recommendation was to raise our county health rankings in the region.\nSince then, Episcopal Health Foundation, whose goal is to improve the health of the 10 million people living throughout the 57-county region served by the Episcopal Diocese of Texas, hosted a community meeting in Nacogdoches specifically to deepen their relationship with organizations working to improve community health in this area. Other foundations have expressed a similar interest.\nBut let\u2019s be very clear: No foundation or partnership is going to do the work for us. We all have to be involved. The amazing thing about Angelina County is the number of resources we already have, along with the incredible people behind them. These resources need to intentionally focus on both individual and community health and work in a coordinated effort to put the pieces of our health puzzle together.\nHospitals must strengthen community outreach, especially with diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer education. Physicians must expand care for the indigent in our communities. It is our duty. The Angelina County & Cities Health District deserves our full support for the incredible care they already provide, but they can, and must, do more. That requires funding, whether from grant support, state government or within Angelina County. Their primary care outreach is crucial to the health of our county.\nOrganizations like the American Cancer Society, The Coalition, ADAC and Burke must expand outreach and education about healthy lifestyles and disease prevention, cancer screening, smoking cessation and immunizations. Women\u2019s Special Services at CHI St. Luke\u2019s Health Memorial will continue to apply for grants for low-income women to get breast and cervical cancer screening.\nLufkin went smoke-free years ago and is better off for it. What about other cities? Diboll? Angelina County? Texas? Our state legislators need to use that proposed bathroom bill as toilet paper and instead pass smoke-free legislation, which we know will both improve the health of our communities and save taxpayer dollars.\nChamber businesses need to provide or strengthen wellness programs for their employees, encouraging healthier lifestyles, diet, exercise and smoking cessation. Maybe if people had to climb two flights of stairs to buy their cigarettes rather than drive through a barn or stop at a convenience store, fewer people would smoke. And they\u2019d lose weight while they were at it. Is it just as easy for us to shop for healthy foods as it is tobacco and junk food? How do we encourage and facilitate healthy eating?\nOur educational institutions from elementary school through college should have comprehensive, intentional programs to promote health and exercise. It is discouraging when I see employees at both our local hospitals riding the elevator to go up one floor when taking the stairs is much more beneficial.\nActive events like the Neches River Rendezvous, Pineywoods Purgatory and Relay for Life are fantastic. What other events can we organize that will involve an even larger and broader swath of people year-round? Find a reason to get outside. Participate in a fun run, even if you simply walk a mile or two. A stroll around the zoo can be good exercise and lots of fun. Or, spend an hour or two hiking the trails at Kit McConnico Park. It\u2019ll do your heart and soul good.\nCity sidewalks have been a great addition in recent years. Use them. Our Parks and Recreation Department has a website with programs and classes as well. Do we have a master plan for parks and recreation activities? If not, maybe we should.\nI have a dream of a coordinated community effort where healthy living concepts infuse everything we do. Will Angelina County catch the vision to join in this effort? Lifestyle changes are hard. Nothing happens overnight. Changes in community health are measured over years \u2014 decades, even. We cannot get discouraged. Slow, meaningful progress over time will make a difference.\nOne early step coming up is the Texas Forest Country Partnership Economic Summit Nov. 7-8 at the Pitser Garrison Convention Center. Included in that summit will be a Rural Health Care Symposium. Though it will address more than just Angelina County health care, it will be an important venue to discuss and brainstorm together. The Texas Forest Country Partnership should continue to take the lead in bringing groups together, applying for and administering grants, and monitoring progress and effectiveness.\nAs we plan for a healthy new direction in Angelina County, I encourage everyone to get involved. Be prepared to work. Come up with concrete ideas that you (or your business or organization) are willing to implement. Where philanthropic support is necessary, we will approach local, regional and national foundations for assistance.\nWe must become the change we want to see and move the needle on health in Angelina County out of the red zone and into the green. Who\u2019s with me?\nDr. Sid Roberts is a radiation oncologist at the Arthur Temple, Sr. Regional Cancer Center in Lufkin. He can be reached at sroberts@memorialhealth.org.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nWaterborne illnesses are on the rise in Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Maria \u2014 and health professionals fear the storm's aftermath could unleash an epidemic on the devastated island.\nThe death toll from the storm rose to 51 on Tuesday, with the two latest victims dying of leptospirosis, a bacterial disease usually spread by contact with contaminated water, Puerto Rico Public Affairs Secretary Ramon Rosario told The Associated Press.\nPeople affected by Hurricane Maria bathe in water piped from a creek in the mountains, in Utuado, Puerto Rico on Oct. 14. Ramon Espinosa / AP\nAuthorities are investigating an additional 74 suspected cases of the infection as well, he said, and at least one previous death was attributed to the disease.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be higher \u2014 it\u2019s like a perfect storm for leptospirosis, \u201d said Llamara Padro-Milano, a nurse who returned last week from a relief trip to Puerto Rico with the American Federation of Teachers. \"People are going to get sick and suffer.\"\nRelated: Puerto Rico Doctor: 'Medical Schools Don't Prepare You for This'\nA spokeswoman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed to NBC News on Wednesday that they had received a shipment of specimens from the U.S. territory and were currently analyzing them at their laboratory in Atlanta for signs of leptospira, the bacteria that causes the disease.\nThe disease is transmitted via exposure to the urine of infected animals, but humans are most commonly infected by coming in contact with contaminated water, especially through skin abrasions and the nose, mouth and eyes, according to World Health Organization.\nOn Thursday, a group of nurses with the union National Nurses United who participated with the trip slammed the federal government's response to the hurricane in a news conference with Democratic lawmakers.\n\"Door to door the nurses assessed and found people who may die before food, water and medicine can reach them,\" said Cathy Kennedy, vice president of the nurses' union.\nThe group released a report Thursday that concluded \"the response to the crisis in Puerto Rico from the U.S. federal government has been unacceptable for the wealthiest country in the world.\"\nThe report called a series of measures to address the crisis, including expanding the use of air drops to provide relief supplies, additional personnel and financial resources, as well as an extension for filing disaster relief claims with FEMA.\nRelated: In Florida, Island Puerto Ricans Ponder Post-Maria Future\nThe over 70 suspected incidents of leptospirosis in just a month would represent a major spike: A total of 729 cases of the disease were reported from 1990-2014 to the Puerto Rico Department of Health, according to a 2016 study in the journal PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases; of those cases, 78 were fatal. However, the study warned that leptospirosis was underreported or misdiagnosed as dengue.\nThe disease has a wide range of symptoms including high fever, headache, chills, vomiting and diarrhea, but some may have no symptoms at all, according to the CDC. Leptospirosis is treated with antibiotics, but without treatment it can lead to kidney damage, meningitis, liver failure and death, according to the CDC.\n\u201cPeople are forced to sleep on dirty mattresses,\" Padro-Milano said. \"If you have no place to wash your hands and you don\u2019t have [hand sanitizer] how are you going to protect yourself?\u201d\n\u201cThe best that we can do was to teach people how to protect themselves the best way we knew how,\u201d she said.\nRandi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers who was in Puerto Rico earlier this month, said she was \u201calarmed\u201d by conditions she saw on the ground, and that mudslides, a devastated infrastructure and destruction throughout the island had created a breeding ground for contamination.\nPeople collect mountain spring water, after Hurricane Maria hit the island, in Corozal, Puerto Rico on Oct. 17.

And mold from houses damaged by rain and floodwaters was contributing to respiratory conditions and diseases, she said.\nA quarter of the island\u2019s population still lacks access to running water as of Wednesday, according to authorities, but the areas that do have water are not evenly distributed.\nWhile 87 percent of the metro area and 88 percent of the south have access to running water, only 46 percent of the north, 68 percent of the west and 77 percent of the east had access, according to a government website.",

        "text": "Oct 19, 2017\n5 Ways Center Centre Better Prepares Students for the Real\u00a0World\nBefore coming to Center Centre I completed my undergraduate studies at a four-year design school where I majored in industrial design.\nAfter I graduated and had some time to reflect on the experience, I was able to recognize how much I loved the time I spent there, as well as how much I learned.\nHowever, I also quickly realized there were a number gaps in my learning that I felt needed to be filled. After doing some research, I found Center Centre and applied.\nNow I\u2019ve completed my first year at Center Centre, I have to say there are some major advantages to attending Center Centre over a traditional four-year design school.\nBelow are five things I\u2019ve found that set Center Centre head and shoulders above learning design in a traditional college setting.\n1) The classroom reflects the work environment.\nA group critique of sketches for our first real world\u00a0project\nWhat I feel sets Center Centre apart from other schools is how they\u2019ve structured the learning environment to more closely resemble the workplace than a classroom. In a traditional college setting you set up your schedule for the semester and attend those scheduled classes until it\u2019s time to schedule the next semester.\nAt Center Centre, the school is set up more like the experience a new designer would have in a junior UX position at a company. Every weekday we go to school from 9 to 5 in the evening.\nDuring that time we work together as a team to complete course work, work on actual projects for real-world clients, have regular and impromptu meetings about topics that need to be discussed and fires to be put out, and much more.\nThis work-like environment can help a student more smoothly transition from the world of academia to the working world without having to adjust to the difference between a classroom and job.\n2) Project work focuses on solving real-world design problems for real-world clients.\nThe projects we work on here are all generated from clients who have existing design problems and need the services of a UX design team, unlike my experiences in the past where either the project was a made-up set of constraints or had no real problem to solve.\nHaving real world projects gives you the experience you need to demonstrate to hiring managers that you know how to work through the unpredictable road of multiple stakeholders and how to communicate with clients.\nThis also provides you with the experience of working on a project where considerably un-academic constraints might arise like shifting budgets, unclear project goals, limited resources, changing expectations, and so on.\n3) You\u2019re assessed on what you know and can do \u2014 not how well you perform on\u00a0tests.\nFacilitators brainstorming with us on different ways of demonstrating what we\u2019ve\u00a0learned\nOne of the things many people notice when learning about the Center Centre experience is the approach to how students learn course material .\nEvery three weeks we start a new course, whether its techniques in conducting user research or coding a website in HTML and CSS or sketching and designing interfaces.\nIn those three weeks we focus on learning that one skill and the practices involved with using that skill.\nWe start with a two-day workshop taught by an industry expert, where we discuss theory and best practices and work toward absorbing knowledge of the domain; this is referred to as the Developing stage.\nAfter completing the Developing stage we then move to what we call Emerging. This is where we demonstrate understanding of the concepts and practice skills we\u2019ve learned to show that we understand how to use them.\nOnce we\u2019ve demonstrated we\u2019re able to apply the skills in a practice setting, we then apply what we\u2019ve learned to a real-world project. This helps to reinforce what you\u2019re learning and also demonstrates to hiring managers you know how to apply these practices to a real project.\nThis idea of reinforced learning helps to ensure you understand the skill you\u2019re learning and how you apply it to your career as a UX designer.\nI\u2019ve found this method of learning to be more effective in retaining the knowledge and skills I\u2019ve learned here and as well as how they worked together as a whole.\n4) A focus on writing\u00a0skills.\nI\u2019ll preface this point with the fact that before I came to Center Centre, I didn\u2019t feel great about my skills as a writer, nor was it my favorite thing to do.\nBut being skilled in writing is not only important to have as a UX designer, it\u2019s an important skill to have professionally in general. How you write and create content for the web is crucial because it\u2019s the direct line of communication between you and your audience.\nAt Center Centre, you learn the writing skills you need as a UX designer during the copywriting and content strategy course. This course was taught to us by Ahava Leibtag who manages her own content strategy consultancy ( Aha Media Group ).\nAhava taught us how to develop and execute on content strategy, how you write copy effectively, and how to tailor language to be understandable for any audience.\nIn addition, having a group of five editors at my disposal (the rest of the students in my cohort) helps ensure I\u2019m presented with alternative viewpoints and approaches that I might not have seen on my own.\nMy writing skills have improved dramatically over the year of attending Center Centre and I\u2019ve learned to appreciate the importance of writing as a skill even more.\n5) Reflecting on your\u00a0work:\nEnd of day refection on how a past employer or boss demonstrated leadership\nAt the end of every day at Center Centre we reflect as a team. A facilitator writes a question on a whiteboard that has us recall on past events, the events of the day, or has us think ahead.\nOne of the benefits of reflecting is that you think about the way you approached your work and take note of how your process can be improved in the future.\nThe act of reflecting makes you more aware of how you work as an individual and within a team, and helps you to capture stories of things that went wrong or things that worked well. These stories are a great framework on which to build a portfolio so that when it comes time to interview for a UX position, you have a ton of great stories of overcoming challenges \u2014 one of the main things hiring managers look for when hiring a UX designer.\nReflecting on your work will make you a better designer and will improve how you approach your work and the process in how you complete it.\n________________________________\nThere are more reasons that didn\u2019t make this list but, in the end, whether at an institution like Center Centre or at a traditional school, the quality of an education is largely about how you apply yourself.\nAt Center Centre, they\u2019ve created a culture of continuous learning and illustrate concepts in a way that motivates students to want to learn, because when you\u2019re working on actual work for actual clients, a career as a practitioner of UX is tangible.\nHere, you\u2019re actually designing solutions to actual problems, which makes concepts truly come off the page and into the world \u2014 an experience that most four-year institutions just can\u2019t touch.\n________________________________\nFor more articles on our experiences here, follow the Center Centre Cohort 1 Blog as we provide you every week with a new article about what we are learning!",

        "text": "Some of the state\u2019s largest employers weighed in Tuesday on the Hartford HealthCare and Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield contract impasse, calling for resolution of a disagreement over reimbursements for medical treatment that threatens coverage for tens of thousands of patients.\n\u201cWe expect a resolution that improves health care quality and access, and insures that high quality care remains affordable for both patients and employers,\u201d the employers said in a letter. \u201cIt is in everyone\u2019s collective best interest \u2014 including your own \u2014 to immediately return to the negotiating table and resolve this dispute once and for all.\u201d\nThe letter was addressed to Jill Hummel, president and general manager of Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield in Connecticut and Elliot Joseph, president and CEO of Hartford HealthCare. It was signed by State Comptroller Kevin Lembo, West Hartford Mayor Shari G. Cantor, West Hartford Town Manager Matthew Hart, Mohegan Tribal Chairman Kevin Brown, and Bob Tessier, executive director of the CT Coalition of Taft-Hartley Health Funds.\nJeff Hamilton, assistant general manager of the Mohegan Sun, said as many as 4,000 of the 7,000 employees at the casino and resort are affected by the dispute. Mohegan Sun, which is self-insured, pays Anthem to administer its health insurance, he said.\nMohegan Sun spends more than $15 million a year for costs related to Hartford HealthCare and leaders of the tribal business worry about escalating health care costs, some of which are passed on to employees.\n\u201cIt goes on the backs of our team members,\u201d he said.\nFor years, Hartford HealthCare and Anthem negotiated rates, which included the hospital group in the insurer\u2019s network of providers. But their most recent contract expired Sept. 30 and the parties, trading accusations of greed and intimidation, have been unable to agree to new rates for certain medical care.\nIn the absence of an agreement, Hartford HealthCare has been removed from Anthem\u2019s network of health providers, leaving tens of thousands of Connecticut patients with the prospect of higher out-of-pocket, out-of-network costs for treatment. Patients with \u201ctrue emergency conditions\u201d can receive treatment at any Hartford HealthCare facilities and pay the in-network rate.\nHartford HealthCare said last week that \u201cwe are deeply concerned that we remain far apart at this date, and do not appear to be close to a resolution.\u201d\nThe Hartford HealthCare network includes Hartford Hospital, the Hospital of Central Connecticut in New Britain, MidState Medical Center in Meriden, Backus Hospital in Norwich, Windham Hospital in Willimantic and the Institute of Living, a Hartford-based institution that treats mental illness and other health conditions.\nAnthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Connecticut is part of one of the nation's largest health benefits companies, which provides coverage to one in eight Americans.\nHundreds of thousands of private and public employees in Connecticut are, or could be affected by the dispute over how much Anthem should pay Hartford HealthCare to reimburse it for the costs of medical treatment it provides. A significant portion of those patients are state employees.\nThomas Woodruff, director of the health care policy and benefit services division of the state comptroller\u2019s office, sent a letter to 50,000 Anthem members on the state health plan who have used HHC providers.\nIn the letter, he outlined their health care alternatives during \u201cthis unacceptable disruption\u201d and included a list of Connecticut hospitals that can be used to avoid paying higher costs for nonemergency care.\nTo avoid financial risk, \u201cwe recommend that Anthem members do not seek non-emergency care at any HHC facility,\u201d Woodruff said.\nAnthem and HHC are keeping details of their talks private. But last week, the bargaining agent for state employee unions complained \u2014 based, it said, on facts it received from large, self-insured employers \u2014 that that the pace at which Hartford HealthCare is pursuing rate increases suggests it is interested more in growth than the delivery of treatment.\n\u201cThose facts include Hartford Healthcare\u2019s receipt of increases compounding at over 65% in the last 7 years, and demanding increases over 6% per year in the upcoming agreement,\u201d the union letter said. \u201cAnd Hartford Healthcare\u2019s use of ever increasing amounts of healthcare dollars in what appears at least to be driven more by an attempt to gain market share and power than an effort to improve medical services for patients and communities.\u201d\nThe employee unions and other sources also said Hartford HealthCare rejected a temporary measure by which Anthem would reimburse it under rates in the expired contract with a promise to retroactively compensate the hospital network for any increase in rates negotiated in the next contract.\nHartford HealthCare said it is negotiating in good faith, as evidenced by its ability to reach agreements with other insurers.\n\u201cHartford HealthCare has been in active negotiations with Anthem since Oct. 26, 2016 \u2014 ample time to reach an agreement,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cHHC spends many months negotiating agreements with insurance companies; in all cases except with Anthem, we always find common ground. A good example is HHC\u2019s ability to enter a contract with Aetna three months early, which we announced last month.\u201d\nThe letter Friday by large employers complained the impasse in negotiations is \u201ccreating unnecessary stress and anxiety.\u201d\n\u201cAs the impasse drags into its fifth week, our employees, members and their families are expressing heightened frustration with both Hartford HealthCare and Anthem,\u201d the letter said.\u201cTheir frustration and desire for in-network care is driving many to consider other health care options.\u201d\nIn mid-October, Connecticut\u2019s congressional delegation wrote to Anthem and Hartford HealthCare expressing their concern for the patients and policyholders \u201caffected by the ongoing impasse.\u201d\nThey called the stalemate \u201cdisruptive and a disservice\u201d to patients and customers.",

        "text": "Autism and Empathy\nEmpathy is difficult. People tend to forget how hard it is, because most of us spend a lot of time around people much like ourselves; or if we\u2019re around people who are quite different, we\u2019ve usually had time to learn how to put ourselves in their shoes. But the history of human treatment of people perceived as \u2018other\u2019 brings home how much of an imaginative leap it actually takes to see things from the perspective of someone really different.\nAs you probably know, autistic people are really quite different from those who are not autistic. Our brains work differently. Perceptions are different. Misunderstandings frequently arise.\nOne of those misunderstandings has lamentably come to be seen by some as a central feature of autism: the notion that autistic people lack empathy. This has been pushed especially hard by Simon Baron-Cohen, who is also well-known for the related (and similarly wrong-headed) \u2018extreme male brain\u2019 interpretation of autism.\nResearch by Damian Milton, Brett Heasman and others brings into focus just how mistaken it is to see deficient empathy as a defining feature of autism. It turns out that allistic observers are at least as bad at reading autistic expressions as vice versa. Milton labels this the \u2018double empathy problem\u2019: any failure of autistic people to empathise effectively with the rest of the population is magnified by the routine failure of allistic people to understand what autistic people are actually feeling.\nThe common lack of allistic empathy for autists is painfully apparent in many of the ways autists are treated. Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA), in common with other behaviourist approaches, is specifically based on modifying behaviour without even attempting to gain any insight into the subject\u2019s internal life (even if it is not always practised that way). The refusal to enter the subject\u2019s point of view shows in the callous use of punishments and withheld rewards. A similarly unempathetic attitude is all to often obvious in institutional settings that autistic people find themselves confined in.\nThe stereotype that autistic people are unempathetic is not completely without basis; just mostly. Partly this is because, as I say, other people are just so different \u2014 but, just as black people in white-dominated societies are much better at empathising with white people than vice versa, we are so surrounded by allistic perspectives throughout our lives that most of us end up getting at least some insight into how they work, even if it takes us longer than most allistic kids and we might never get it completely. So cognitive empathy (or \u2018theory of mind\u2019) with allistics is harder for us, just as cognitive empathy with autistics is harder for them. Anyone who\u2019s spent time in a peer support group for people on the autistic spectrum will tell you that cognitive empathy between us is generally not such a problem.\nAffective empathy needs to be considered separately, although it\u2019s not always possible to cleanly distinguish the two. This is the side of empathy sometimes coldly called \u2018emotional contagion\u2019 \u2014 where other people\u2019s emotions just sort of leak in when you witness them. On average, autistic people have about as much of this as anyone else. It\u2019s complicated, however, by difficulty with non-verbal cues, and the monotropic tendency to completely miss things when we\u2019re not tuned in to them \u2014 and to experience things very intensely when we are.\nSometimes tuning out other people\u2019s emotions is an important coping strategy, avoiding overwhelming feelings coming in from outside. Other times, failing to tune in to the emotions of others is a simple mistake. Some of us end up tuning that stuff out most of the time, perhaps as a response to an exceptionally difficult upbringing. John Elder Robison, an autistic author and advocate, found that TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) left him suddenly experiencing other people\u2019s emotions, and his own, with an intensity that was hard to handle. This experience has been characterised misleadingly as feeling empathy \u2018for the first time\u2019, but it is possible the treatment really pulled down psychological barriers erected in his youth. Many autists remain intensely empathic throughout our lives.\nThe myth of the unempathetic autist is one of the most harmful stereotypes facing autistic people. It\u2019s on a par with the related notion that we\u2019re unemotional, which is even more misguided: we tend to experience emotions very strongly, we just don\u2019t always connect with them or express them in the same ways as other people. Along with the damaging preconceptions it gives people about autistics, it also leads to some people (often women) not getting diagnosed because they\u2019re thought to be \u2018too empathetic to be autistic\u2019.\nNobody is too empathetic to be autistic, just as nobody is too emotional, or too extroverted. It\u2019s high time we put these myths to bed, and concentrate on building empathy for the autistic mind. The \u2018theory of mind deficit\u2019 interpretation of autism is a deeply deficient theory of autistic minds.",

        "text": "Their families are suffering in Puerto Rico. The Army needs them in Alaska.\nby Matt White October 11, 2017\nStaff Sgt. Jamie Montes, a military police officer with the 49th Missile Defense Battalion, on security detail at the Missile Defense Complex at Fort Greely, Alaska. He is one of several dozen National Guard soldiers from Puerto Rico who are on duty away from loved ones affected by Hurricane Maria. (Sean Kimmons/U.S. Army)\nEight days after Hurricane Maria throttled Puerto Rico, Army Spc. Julio Ortiz, a military policeman stationed in Fort Greely, Alaska, finally heard from his mother.\nThe news from home was unsettling.\nIn Sabana Grande, a village of roughly 25,000 on Puerto Rico\u2019s mountainous southwest corner, \u201cI don\u2019t have water,\u201d she said in an emotional video message to her son, captured by a sergeant in Oritz\u2019s former unit in San Juan who trekked across the island to check on the soldier\u2019s family. \u201cI don\u2019t have nothing,\u201d she added, \u201cbut I am alive.\u201d\n[ The new general in Puerto Rico details his plan to speed relief as more troops arrive ]\nOrtiz is one of about 60 members of the Puerto Rico National Guard who have been posted to Fort Greely, where they help\u00a0guard the antimissile interceptors designed to protect the U.S. mainland from a possible nuclear missile strike. It is among the military\u2019s most remote postings on U.S. soil: an hour\u2019s drive to the nearest city, Fairbanks, and another six to Anchorage\u00a0\u2014 from which a flight to Puerto Rico can take at least\u00a013 hours.\nIn the deadly storm\u2019s aftermath, these soldiers have felt uniquely isolated and alone. When not on duty, they\u2019ve been\u00a0glued to their laptops, phones and TVs, desperate for any word from home.\n\u201cFor probably 24 to 48 hours, there was radio silence and no one heard anything,\u201d said Lt. Col. Orlando Ortega, who commands the Alaska National Guard\u2019s 49th Missile Defense Battalion and has family ties to Puerto Rico. \u201cThen stories started coming out.\u201d\nOne soldier learned an uncle had been killed in the storm.\nThree others discovered\u00a0their families\u2019 homes were destroyed.\n[ FEMA administrator: Puerto Rico\u2019s politics, lack of unity, hindering hurricane response ]\nThe Puerto Rico National Guard hires and trains many MPs, as military police are known, but it has few full-time jobs available for them on the island.\u00a0Most are kept on part-time status,\u00a0earning\u00a0pay\u00a0only when they\u2019re on duty and with far fewer benefits, such as health care.\nThe battalion in Alaska, one of only two such units in the U.S. military, is on 24-hour alert, tasked with\u00a0monitoring for incoming ballistic missile attacks. Envisioned as a Cold War counter to Russian threats, the interceptor mission has come back into the spotlight\u00a0after\u00a0North Korea demonstrated new rockets that appear capable of reaching the\u00a0United States.\nGround-based interceptor missiles are stored in underground silos at the Missile Defense Complex, Fort Greely, Alaska. (U.S. Army photo)\nTo keep such sensitive technology secure, the 49th Missile Defense Battalion\u00a0has 130 full-time MP jobs. But it has long struggled to\u00a0recruit\u00a0Alaska National Guard troops willing to spend three years in one of the state\u2019s most demanding and austere assignments.\nHundreds of Puerto Rican troops have stepped in over the years and now account for about half of all MPs assigned to the unit. Most choose to move their families to Fort Greely, forming\u00a0what Ortega called a \u201cvery tight-knit\u201d community because, he said, \u201cAll we have is each other here.\u201d\nThe\u00a0devastation\u00a0in Puerto Rico \u2014 and what has been a\u00a0painstaking\u00a0recovery \u2014 has\u00a0proved stressful and distracting, soldiers say.\u00a0Apart from their anxiety about\u00a0their loved ones\u2019 safety and well-being, many have been cut off from their finances, unable to make withdrawals and pay bills\u00a0as banks throughout\u00a0the island\u00a0are\u00a0slow to come back online.\nThose who lost family members or\u00a0whose homes were destroyed were sent to Puerto Rico immediately in Maria\u2019s aftermath.\u00a0The battalion\u2019s missile defense mission is a top national security priority, so the battalion\u2019s other members have remained at Fort Greely. That has been tough for those who joined the National Guard expecting that one day they would be called upon to help after such a disaster.\nNew Puerto Rico stats via Pentagon show some progress after Maria, albeit very slow. 15% now have electricity. 57% now have drinking water.\n\u2014 Dan Lamothe (@DanLamothe) October 10, 2017\n\u201cYou\u2019re caught in a dilemma,\u201d Ortega said. \u201cWe all understand we are all the shield of the nation from intercontinental ballistic missiles, which is a national strategic mission for protecting the people of the United States. At the same time, your own people, your island, your family members are suffering and you want to run and help them. It\u2019s a pull they have. If they were back in Puerto Rico, they would be helping people.\u201d\nThe frustration has been particularly acute for Ortiz. As a 15-year police officer in Puerto Rico, he has training and relationships that would make a difference. \u201cHere,\u201d he said, \u201cI can do nothing.\u201d\nAt 36, as one of the unit\u2019s older soldiers, he finds himself rallying the younger troops, encouraging them to stay focused \u2014 and have faith.\n\u201cI know we have family but we cannot start crying because we don\u2019t know nothing about them,\u201d Ortiz said. \u201cWe have to pray to Jesus that everyone\u2019s okay.\u201d\nMore from Checkpoint:",

Less than a minute into his remarks, Californians living near fracking, oil refineries and Aliso Canyon stood up and decried the destruction that Brown\u2019s industry-pandering fossil fuel polices have had on their lives.\nI bellowed with them, our collective words silencing the audience. Met with demands of \u201ckeep it in the ground\u201d from Richmond\u2019s refinery communities, Brown yelled back , \u201cLet\u2019s put you in the ground so we can get on with the show here.\u201d\nOpinion\nI was shocked by Brown\u2019s disrespectful and condescending retorts, but even more so by the crowd that cheered him on. Even at a climate change conference, the stories of impacted communities fell on deaf ears.\nSIGN UP\nBe the first to know.\nNo one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story.\nSIGN ME UP!\nMany are desperately holding onto hope that Brown will fill the Trump-sized hole in the nation\u2019s climate leadership. But the truth is that his rhetoric on global warming hides his support for aggressive oil and gas extraction in our state. California should not be held up as a shining example for other states and countries.\nMany don\u2019t know that California is the third-largest oil-producing state, or that oil companies extract millions of barrels every year of some of the dirtiest oil on the planet, far worse for our climate than Canada\u2019s notorious tar sands oil.\nEven as Brown dons his climate hero cape, he\u2019s not curbing oil extraction. California regulators issue thousands of new drilling permits each year, including a projected 2,600 new wells a year in Kern County for decades to come.\nTo avert a climate catastrophe, it is urgently necessary to keep oil in the ground. Yet with toothless regulations and tax breaks, California rolls out the red carpet for oil and gas development.\nCalifornia and Pennsylvania are the only oil-producing states that do not levy a tax on extraction. Brown administration officials are relentlessly seeking exemptions from the federal Safe Drinking Water Act to allow oil companies to dump toxic fluids into underground water supplies.\nBrown has pressured regulators to speed up permitting for oil companies, firing officials who did not comply. He has refused to ban fracking despite its use of toxic chemicals and the fact that it is fundamentally incompatible with fighting climate change. And he has failed to shut down the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility, where the largest methane leak in U.S. history forced thousands to flee their homes.\nCompounding the climate damage, many California oilfields operate dangerously close to homes and schools, emitting air pollutants that cause asthma, cancer and other health problems. Fourteen percent of Californians live within a mile of an oil or gas well. Drilling occurs disproportionally in low-income communities already choked by pollution.\nThe local and global damage from California\u2019s dirty oil production demand nothing less than a rapid phase-out within the next several decades. California must ban fracking and halt permits for new drilling, fossil fuel infrastructure and oil field expansion. The state should eliminate subsidies and use the money to transition to clean energy, invest in public transportation and ban the sale of fossil fuel vehicles by 2025.\nTrue climate leadership starts at home. Brown, despite his global hype, is failing this test.",

        "text": "Serving in the military can boost women\u2019s future earnings and quash significant racial and ethnic disparities in pay, a new study has found.\nWhile white women traditionally make thousands more each year than their black, Hispanic and Native American peers, a recent report out of Florida State University shows that veteran women of color out-earn same-race nonveterans and also make more than white women who have not served in the military. Veteran women of all races earn about 8 percent more than nonveteran women.\nOccupation has a lot to do with it. The study notes that while women of color are overrepresented in low-wage positions, veteran women are more likely to work in management roles than nonveteran women and also have higher representation in healthcare and protective service jobs, which include security and law enforcement.\n\"It\u2019s as though military service saved them from some of the bad opportunities that their sisters face,\" said Irene Padavic, the lead researcher on the study and a professor of sociology who has been researching women veterans since 2000.\nThe study, \"Aiming High: Explaining the Earnings Advantage for Female Veterans,\" comes at a time when women represent a growing share of service members. In 2015, when the Department of Defense made the groundbreaking decision to open combat positions to women, women made up 15.5 percent of the active duty enlisted force and 17 percent of officers \u2013 up from 14.7 percent and 14.4 percent in 2000, respectively, according to a Department of Defense demographics report.\nIt\u2019s not entirely clear whether the skills women learn in the military contribute to their higher earnings in the civilian workforce, Padavic said. The study, to be published in the Armed Forces & Society journal in April, is based on Census Bureau data of 18- to 55-year-old women from 2008 to 2010, which does not include information on military occupation specialties.\nOne key takeaway of the study, however, is that the \"veteran premium was large enough to raise the earnings of disadvantaged minorities to be on par with white women in the civilian labor force \u2013 and sometimes even higher,\" Padavic said.\nAcross all races, veteran women earned more than 115 percent of what their same-race, nonveteran counterparts earned.\nAfter averaging variables such as education, occupation, number of hours worked and children in the home, researchers in the FSU study determined that the predicted mean earnings of nonveteran white women were $1,925 higher than nonveteran black women, $2,078 higher than Hispanic women, and $6,188 higher than Native American women. Among veterans, the wage gap dramatically decreased \u2013 most strikingly down to only $86 between white and Hispanic women.\nAsian women are the exception. Both nonveterans and veterans out-earn all other groups of women, which the study attributes to higher levels of educational attainment.\nSource: \"Aiming High: Explaining the Earnings Advantage for Female Veterans,\" Armed Forces & Society\nPhoto Credit: Illustration by Devan Feeney/Staff\nEmily Martin, general counsel and vice president for workplace justice at the National Women\u2019s Law Center, said one reason for the overall wage gap between men and women \u2013 80 cents for every dollar \u2013 and the specific wage gap by demographic group is \"definitely because women, and specifically women of color, are still being paid less for doing the same job.\"People still bring gender and racial stereotypes into decisions about pay, even subconsciously, she said. And women of color experience other obstacles associated with their race, including discrimination and access to educational opportunities associated with higher-paying jobs.The Florida State study doesn\u2019t mean that all women would be better off joining the military, Padavic said.\"Veteran status has a bigger payoff for minority women than for white women,\" the report states. \"These findings indicate that the bridge to better employment provided by military service is especially effective for women with the lowest civilian labor-market opportunities \u2013 namely, disadvantaged minorities.\"But because white and Asian women face better labor-market prospects, military experience may not produce the same payoff as if they had spent time investing in civilian careers, according to the report.Padavic said this study sets up interesting questions that could use further research, such as how experience in combat roles will affect women\u2019s job prospects after the military.\"Nowadays when women depend solely on their own earnings to support themselves and their families, we need to know how well they\u2019re able to do that after a spell in the military,\" she said.",

        "text": "Seoul, South Korea (CNN) North Korea has accepted South Korea's proposal for official talks in what will be the first high-level contact between the two countries in more than two years.\nSouth Korean Unification Ministry spokesman Baik Tae-hyun told reporters Friday that North Korea informed Seoul by fax that it has accepted the offer to initiate talks.\nThe person-to-person talks will be held Tuesday -- the day after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's birthday -- at the Peace House in the village of Panmunjom in the Demilitarized Zone, Baik said.\nThe two sides agreed to work on the details of the talks \"through the exchange of documents,\" Baik said, adding that agenda items will be \"issues related to improving inter-Korean relationships, including the Pyeongchang Olympic Games.\"\nA statement from the International Olympic Committee said it welcomes talks aimed at having North Korean athletes compete in next month's Winter Games in South Korea.\nThe IOC said it was continuing discussions with the North Korean National Olympic Committee and keeping its invitation open for a delegation.\nNorth Korean figure skaters Ryom Tae-Ok and Kim Ju-Sik have qualified for the Pyeongchang Olympics.\nTwo North Korean athletes, figure skaters Ryom Tae-Ok and Kim Ju-sik, have qualified for the Games. While Pyongyang has missed a registration deadline for the two, the IOC could allow an exception to be made.\nThe faxed message accepting the long-standing offer of talks was from Ri Son-kwon, chairman of the North Korean Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland. It was addressed to South Korean Unification Minister Cho Myoung-Gyon, Baik said.\nBaik said the decision of who would attend the meetings was still being finalized.\nThe last such high-level talk was a deputy ministerial meeting in December 2015 at the jointly run Kaesong Industrial Complex in North Korea.\nThe complex, which opened in 2004 in a rare show of cooperation between the two Koreas, was shuttered last year as Pyongyang ramped up its missile and nuclear testing.\nPossible thaw\nThe announcement of talks comes on the heels of other signs of rapprochement between the two rivals.\nAt least five calls have been placed through the cross-border channel since then, according to the South Korean Unification Ministry. In what's widely regarded as a diplomatic breakthrough, a hotline between Seoul and Pyongyang rang again in recent days after going unused for two years.At least five calls have been placed through the cross-border channel since then, according to the South Korean Unification Ministry.\nContact between the countries has resumed since the North Korean leader expressed hope during his New Year's Day address that a North Korean delegation might participate in the Winter Games.\nKim also expressed a desire for a peaceful resolution to the decades-old conflict with South Korea. The Korean War ended in an armistice in 1953, meaning the two nations technically have been at war since then.\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in told CNN last year that North Korean participation in the Pyeongchang Olympics would \"provide a very good opportunity for inter-Korean peace and reconciliation.\"\nRussia to US: Don't undermine talks\nA top Russian official welcomed the restoration of communication and urged the United States to avoid making threatening statements that could undermine talks.\naccording to \"We are pleased to note the readiness of Seoul and Pyongyang to have direct contacts,\" Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Friday,according to Russian state-run news agency TASS.\nCalling the new developments \"a step in the right direction,\" Ryabkov said, \"The hotline is a useful and important tool for de-escalation in unforeseen circumstances.\" He said Russia will work with all players to help improve the state of affairs on the Korean Peninsula.\n\"In this situation, other participants in this drama should be extremely cautious, balanced and restrained in statements and assessments so as not to undermine such a fragile chance for some more or less stable political process,\" he said. \"Accordingly, statements of a threatening nature, signals, even if not from officials but from politicians, still have an impact on the situation.\"\nJUST WATCHED White House defends Trump's nuclear taunting Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH White House defends Trump's nuclear taunting 01:58\nStronger hand\nThe advanced stage of North Korea's weapons program could afford its leadership the luxury of diplomacy, said Tong Zhao, a North Korea analyst and fellow at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy.\n\"I think Kim Jong Un is now (in) a different position after the Hwasong-15 (long-range missile) testing. At a minimum, North Korea has achieved a rudimentary strategic deterrent and can afford to not continue testing. ... North Korea apparently has plans to mass-produce missiles and nuclear warheads but could (now) consider a moratorium on ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) tests.\"\nZhao said he views the resumption of talks as a positive sign and considers next week's meeting to be a first step in improving bilateral relations.\n\"After Kim Jong Un made the overture in his New Year address, the two sides quickly resumed the hotline and agreed to meet -- the pace of development is very quick,\" he said.\n\"There is an indication that North Korea wants to explore broader issues. I expect they will engage in other issues as well (at the talks). ... It's hard to tell how quickly they will settle the Olympic issue, but it's clear that both sides want to go further with these talks.\"\nDiffering reaction\nA similar sense of optimism has yet to extend beyond the Korean Peninsula.\nOn Thursday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called North Korea's nuclearization \"absolutely unacceptable \" and said his country's security situation was the most severe since World War II.\nUS officials have so far maintained a similarly skeptical stance regarding Kim's sincerity in soothing tensions.\nSpeaking Tuesday, Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the United Nations, issued a stern warning to North Korea, saying Washington \"will never accept a nuclear North Korea.\"\nHowever, the hard-line US stance may be softening in light of recent developments. In a phone call Thursday, President Donald Trump and Moon agreed not to host joint military drills during the period of the Pyeongchang Olympics, according to a South Korean government statement.\nA senior US military official also confirmed to CNN there would be no joint exercises during the Games.\n\"(Even) if South Korea-North Korea relations improve thanks to the Olympics, the US-South Korea (military) drills will still take place after that, which could still be major reason for turbulence going forward,\" said Zhao, the North Korea analyst.\nKim has long criticized the US-South Korean drills, declaring them a direct threat to Pyongyang, and a possible barrier to the resumption of diplomatic talks.\nThe decision to hold off on military drills is a diplomatic response from the US President, who earlier this week bragged in a tweet that his nuclear button was \"much bigger & more powerful\" than Kim's.\nTrump has since sought to take credit for the resumption of communications between Pyongyang and Seoul.\n\"With all of the failed 'experts' weighing in, does anybody really believe that talks and dialogue would be going on between North and South Korea right now if I wasn't firm, strong and willing to commit our total 'might' against the North,\" Trump tweeted Thursday morning.\n\"Fools, but talks are a good thing!\" he added.",

        "text": "Washington (CNN) More than 60 years after a space race rivalry with the Soviet Union ushered in a new era of ballistic missile development, the US is facing another \"Sputnik moment\" amid a rapidly escalating international competition over artificial intelligence, according to former Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work.\nThe idea that rapid advances in artificial intelligence will define the next generation of warfare -- a concept known as the \"Third Offset Strategy\" -- was first articulated by former Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel in 2014.\nPossible AI applications for the military include: creating more nimble systems, possibly at lower cost; developing more effective training systems; software that processes mountains of data from surveillance systems or for \"pattern-of-life\" surveillance; improved facial recognition capabilities; war games support and automated combat in so-called manned-unmanned operations, according to a September report from the RAND Corporation\nBut a new report published Wednesday and provided exclusively to CNN by Work and Govini, a data and analytics firm that conducts government analysis, warns that the US military must now decide if it wants to \"lead the coming revolution, or fall victim to it\" amid emerging challenges from China and Russia.\n\"This stark choice will be determined by the degree to which the Department of Defense (DoD) recognizes the revolutionary military potential of AI and advanced autonomous systems,\" the report said.\nSpecifically, the White House and Pentagon must determine the extent to which the US will ramp up research and development in technologies associated with artificial intelligence -- including advanced computing, artificial neural networks, big data, machine learning, unmanned systems and robotics, it said.\nThe US must also determine a national strategy for how aggressively it will develop new systems, operational concepts and organizational constructs that exploit artificial intelligence advancements in warfare, according to the report.\nAn important part of that strategy relates to \"autonomy\" which results \"from delegation of a decision to an authorized entity to take action within specific boundaries,\" Work told CNN.\nThe technology\nWhile critics have often warned against the development of autonomous offensive weaponry for fear of losing operational control, Work told CNN that the US pursuit of \"narrow AI\" will always prioritize human control but allow the machine to \"independently compose and select among different courses of action to accomplish assigned goals based on its knowledge and understanding of the world, itself, and the situation.\"\nJUST WATCHED Musk, Zuckerberg feud over future of AI Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Musk, Zuckerberg feud over future of AI 05:05\n\"They are worried about the Terminator, but the US view is more like the Iron Man,\" Work said in reference to the Marvel superhero who is a man equipped with a powerful and adaptable suit of armor.\nThe US has already begun to apply elements of AI to military platforms and strategy -- a move perhaps no more evident than in its investment in the $400 billion F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.\nCombining an array of sensors and software used to quickly collect data and interpret data, the F-35 \"is the key example of human elaboration,\" Work told CNN.\n\"It sucks up data and portrays that to the pilot in a way they couldn't have done on their own,\" he added, calling the aircraft a \"perfect example of human-machine collaboration\" that should be applied to other military platforms.\nBut despite some success in implementing AI technology to date, Work told CNN that he does not \"don't believe our national response is nearly good enough to this point.\"\nThe race\nBoth China and Russia have recently highlighted the importance of artificial intelligence to the future of the global economy and military power.\nSpeaking to students during a national \"open lesson\" in September, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the country that takes the lead in the sphere of computer-based artificial intelligence will rule.\n\"Artificial intelligence is the future not only of Russia but of all of mankind,\" said Putin. \"There are huge opportunities, but also threats that are difficult to foresee today.\"\nThe words of the Russian President echo what scientists in Russia and around the world have been mulling over for quite some time.\nWork on developing drones and vehicles for military and civilian usage is well under way in Russia, according to state media.\nThe Russian military is also developing robots, anti-drone systems, and cruise missiles that would be able to analyze radars and make decisions on the altitude, speed and direction of their flight, according to state media.\nAnd in July, the Chinese government published a detailed road map outlining a national plan to prioritize the development and application of AI -- a move Work said he considers a \"Sputnik moment.\"\n\"Artificial intelligence has become the new focus of international competition. Artificial intelligence is the strategic technology that leads the future,\" the Chinese government publication said.\n\"The major developed countries in the world regard the development of artificial intelligence as a major strategy to enhance their national competitiveness and safeguard their national security,\" it added.\nChina's hopes to lead the world in AI technologies by directly linking defense and commercial development.\nThe funding\nWhile DOD and Silicon Valley have recently invested in AI research and development, relying on American commercial research and development is not going to be enough, according to Work.\nThe US has lacked a clear plan to keep pace with foreign rivals despite predictions that AI \"has the potential to be a transformative national security technology, on a par with nuclear weapons, aircraft, computers, and biotech,\" according to a recent study by Greg Allen of Harvard's Belfer Center for Science and International studies.\nBut according to Work and Govini, Wednesday's report aims to help build the foundation of a national response to, what they view, as a clear challenge by foreign powers.\nBy providing an analysis of government spending on key components of AI between 2012 and 2017, the report provides guidance for defense leaders and the White House on how the US should respond to challenges from China and others, Work said.\nAnd while the report generally concludes that DOD is \"putting its money where its mouth is\" when it comes to the Third Offset Strategy, Work told CNN that there is still \"a long way to go.\"\nThe report's analysis of unclassified government spending on AI over the last five years indicates that DOD is focusing on collecting data and applying it to two primary components of the offset strategy: virtual reality (simulations and training technology) and computer vision (the data that tells a system what to strike and not to strike).\nWhile important foundational elements of artificial intelligence, the US must begin to prioritize measures toward applying those advancements toward mission concepts, according to Matt Hummer of Govini.\nDOD should increase its investment in \"advanced computing\" technology -- which represents the lynchpin for broader application -- and analytical technology -- which is used to display information to a human operator, he said.\nFurther development of the Cloud -- a critical part of increasing processing speed -- is also an area the US should emphasize, he said.\nUltimately, an emphasis on prioritizing artificial intelligence spending is going to \"require a national response led from the White House,\" according to Work.\n\"This is designed, I hope, to not only help DOD leaders to think about what to invest in but help the White House to think about broad contours of a national response,\" he said.",

That said, the unemployment rate held steady at 4.1%, which is very low.\nThe revisions from the previous two months were mixed, with October\u2019s totals revised down and November\u2019s totals revised up. Combined, they pointed to a net loss of 9,000 jobs, which adds to the discouraging nature of today\u2019s report.\nProviding some additional context, now that we have data for all of the previous calendar year, we can note that the U.S. added 2.09 million jobs in 2011, 2.14 million jobs in 2012, 2.3 million in 2013, 2.99 million in 2014, 2.71 million in 2015, 2.24 million in 2016, and 2.05 million in 2017.*\nOr put another way, while Donald Trump\u2019s first year as president has been pretty good overall for job creation, Americans nevertheless saw the slowest job growth in six years. (Note, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will revise the 2017 data once more, making the available figures preliminary.)\nAbove you\u2019ll find the chart I run every month, showing monthly changes in total jobs since the start of the Great Recession. The image makes a distinction: red columns point to monthly changes under the Bush and Trump administrations, while blue columns point to monthly job changes under the Obama administration.\nUpdate: Here\u2019s another chart, this one showing monthly job losses/gains in just the private sector since the start of the Great Recession.\n* Correction: It looks like I missed some BLS revisions from several years ago. The total from 2012, for example, should\u2019ve been 2.14 million, not 2.19 million, and the total from 2015 should\u2019ve been 2.71 million. not 2.74 million. The above text and chart have been corrected, and the larger observation \u2013 about this being the slowest year for job growth in six years \u2013 remains unaffected by the changes.",

Arias had previously pleaded not guilty to a five-count indictment.\nA federal immigration judge in June 2017 ordered Arias removed from the United States, and he waived his right to appeal that decision. His removal is pending, as immigration officials plans to execute the judge's removal order, Alberico said.\nSet for Feb. 20, Arias' trial had already been rescheduled several times and was likely about to be pushed again, according to a recent court order and the priest's lawyer.\nOn Friday, Arias pleaded guilty to battery, a class A misdemeanor. He agreed to a sentence of 205 days in county jail with credit for time served.\nKane County Jail records showed Arias was released as scheduled Saturday morning.\nKane County Circuit Judge Linda Abrahamson, who has been presiding over the case, accepted the plea.\nWithout the guilty plea, Arias' attorney David Camic said it appeared certain the trial would have been continued again \"because we were about to file some additional pretrial motions.\"\nCamic said the plea is supported by the facts in the case and that Arias \"did not commit a criminal sexual offense.\"\nImmigration officials first arrested Arias at the county's St. Charles courthouse while he was free on bond after a hearing in May.

For many years, leaders of the retail industry were averse to change \u2013 they wanted everything to be smooth and as long as they beat \u201clast year,\u201d they were happy.\nThis is no longer possible.\nIn the past, it was the retailer who determined what a customer should want to buy and how they should shop. Today, it\u2019s the customer who is defining the shopping experience. And a retailer is missing opportunities for sales when it operates in the traditional silos that kept merchandise categories and selling channels separate rather than coordinated.\nThe acceptance of omni-channel trade and digital savvy merchandising is important. Today it is a requirement for success. However, it is not only acceptance of new ideas, but I also see the need to review old systems and procedures. Store operations and mindsets must change.\nSome have assumed that Amazon is going to kill the industry, that everything will be bought online. Well, as we have recently seen, it\u2019s not that simple. On one side, we see stores like Walmart waking up and moving aggressively into the same online arena. And, Amazon is redefining itself as well. I am not surprised that Amazon is opening some stores, and buying companies like Whole Foods to gain dominance. I do believe that they will be a strong player but will not eliminate good competition.\n2017 was the year of digital discovery. 2018 will be the year of technology and more integration of it into mainstream retail. It will be the year where we see retailers create new operating models that are less focused on their store vs. the web and more focused on creating experiences that gives customers more control and convenient ways to shop. I think it will be an exciting year where customers will find newness and creativity.\nI predict that most well-funded retailers and department stores will adjust and survive. They will slim down further and concentrate on destination mega-malls. They will attract customers because they know fashion, have the brands that appeal, learn to have quicker turnover of their assortment and add innovations that take hold.",

Over the course of his career, Cunningham choreographed more than 150 dances and over 800 \u201cEvents.\u201d Cunningham\u2019s lifelong passion for exploration and innovation made him a leader in applying new technologies to the arts. He began investigating dance on film in the 1970s, and choreographed using the computer program DanceForms during the latter part of his career. He explored motion capture technology to create d\u00e9cor for BIPED (1999), and his interest in new media led to the creation of Mondays with Merce. An active choreographer and mentor to the arts world until his death at the age of 90, Cunningham earned some of the highest honors bestowed in the arts. Among his many awards are the National Medal of Arts (1990) and the MacArthur Fellowship (1985). Cunningham\u2019s life and artistic vision have been the subject of four books and three major exhibitions, and his works have been presented by groups including the Ballet of the Paris Op\u00e9ra, New York City Ballet, American Ballet Theater, White Oak Dance Project, and London\u2019s Rambert Dance Company. Cunningham passed away in his New York City home on July 26, 2009. Always forward-thinking, Cunningham developed the precedent-setting Legacy Plan prior to his death, to guide his Company and ensure the preservation of his artistic legacy. His collaborations with artistic innovators from every creative discipline have yielded an unparalleled body of American dance, music, and visual art. Cunningham\u2019s work with John Cage, his life partner from the 1940s until Cage\u2019s death in 1992, had the greatest influence on his practice. Together, Cunningham and Cage proposed a number of radical innovations. The most famous and controversial of these concerned the relationship between dance and music, which they concluded may occur in the same time and space, but could be created independently of one another. Cunningham was a leader of the American avant-garde throughout his seventy-year career and is considered one of the most important choreographers of our time. ABOUT CAROL TEITELBAUM\nCarol Teitelbaum, was a member of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company from 1986 to 1993. She joined the faculty of the Merce Cunningham Dance Studio in 1985 and was faculty chair from 1998 until the studio closed in 2011. Ms. Teitelbaum has staged dances from the Cunningham repertory at State University of New York at Purchase, Barnard College, Ballet de Lorraine, the Cunningham Repertory Understudy Group and the Merce Cunningham Dance Company. She has extensive experience teaching Merce Cunningham Technique\u00ae and repertory to dancers of all levels of expertise, from professional company members to fourth grade students. As a respected stager of the work of Cunningham, she teaches selected dances from the repertory, as licensed by the Cunningham Trust. She also shares the Cunningham repertory more informally, by selecting material from various dances and connecting these elements to form a MinEvent. Ms. Teitelbaum has taught master classes and held guest teaching positions at many institutions, including Stanford University, the University of Michigan, the Conservatoire de Paris, La Guardia High School of the Performing Arts and the Ailey/Fordham BFA program. Ms. Teitelbaum holds a Master's of Fine Arts in Dance from the University of Michigan. Currently, she teaches for the Cunningham Trust at City Center and at Marymount Manhattan College.

I won\u2019t leave gift shopping until the last minute and stress myself out. These are promises plenty of us make to ourselves as the holiday season gets into full swing. And they\u2019re promises most of us will break.\nThat's because it's easy for healthy intentions to go MIA when a coworker pulls together a last-minute happy hour plan, or you made yourself a way-too-long gift shopping list, or you took on another holiday-related responsibility that's throwing you off your game. 'Tis the season for excess, we know, but striving for balance and maintaining your usual healthy habits during December will also help you avoid starting the new year with a #dietstartstomorrow mentality.\nTo help you survive the month with your mind and body strong and begin 2018 on the right foot, we rounded up five simple things you can do right now.\nRELATED: 5 Ways to Ease Holiday Stress in 5 Minutes or Less\nBuy a pack of gym classes\nDropping some cash ahead of time for a 10-pack of classes or one-month class pass at your favorite fitness studio may be pricey. But knowing that they're already paid for will motivate you to keep up your sweat sessions all season long\u2014because not even a holiday cookie swap can convince you to throw money out the window. Buy them now, and you'll have a few left over to use during the first week of January, so you're inspired to follow through on your New Year's fitness resolution as well.\nGet cooking\nChances are you\u2019ll catch up with friends over drinks or brunch this month. Instead of chatting over high-calorie eggs Benedict or cocktails, connect in a setting where healthy food is the focus\u2014like a cooking class. Book a vegetarian class for you and your girlfriend ahead of time, or make a Sunday meal prep date now, so you\u2019ll have nutritious meal options on hand when the holidays close in. Having good-for-you eats already prepped will help make last-minute holiday cookie dough binges less likely.\nRELATED: 5 Healthy Baking Swaps You Need to Try\nSlim down your holiday dinner\nHeading to a festive potluck? Do a little research to find recipes similar to yours that use lower-fat ingredients, Wendy Bazilian, RD, nutritionist and co-author of Eat Clean, Stay Lean, suggested in a prior interview with Health. \u201cEven better, find a version that incorporates some healthy foods that simultaneously bump up the nutrition while reducing extra calories, sugars, or fat.\u201d\nA few swap ideas we love: If you\u2019re tasked with bringing dip to a party, substitute protein-rich Greek yogurt for sour cream. Or cook up whipped cauliflower instead of mashed potatoes. Hey, every bit counts.\nWATCH THE VIDEO: A 5-Minute Meditation to Help You Find Your Calm Now\nSubscribe to a self-care box\nTreat yourself to a subscription box today that will make staying healthy through the holiday season so much easier. Sign on with a meal kit delivery service so you already know you have good-for-you meals covered, or subscribe to a beauty box ($30 for 3 months, birchbox.com) that will tame your stressed-out skin during party season. Being proactive will automatically make you feel like you\u2019re starting December on a high note. Plus, who wants to make a last-minute drugstore run for sparkly eye shadow on New Year's Eve?\nDownload a meditation app\nThe holiday season may be the most wonderful time of the year, but it\u2019s also the most hectic, when your usual routine falls by the wayside and family and friends you've avoided all year long come back into your life. Not surprisingly, your mental health can take a hit. To stress less this December, download one of these apps that take you through guided meditations and mindfulness exercises. We have a feeling they\u2019ll come in handy after your family talks politics at the dinner table.",

The one-shot, set for release May 2, will not only include a Man of Steel prelude by Brian Michael Bendis and Jose Luis Garcia-Lopez, but also a prelude to Scott Snyder, James Tynion IV and Joshua Williamson's Justice League: No Justice and a major turning point in Tom King's Batman romance between Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle (Catwoman).\nKing's Batman story will focus on the Joker becoming aware of Batman and Catwoman's impending nuptials and his reactions (a clue: \"He's not happy.\") The publisher said this builds to a climax for the wedding story arc planned for July 4's Batman #50.\nSnyder, Tynion IV, and Williamson are working with Jorge Jimenez on a preview of Justice League: No Justice, which itself launches a week later on May 9 with a four-issue weekly title.\nThe presumed Justice League line-up in Jimenez's DC Nation #0 cover is note-worthy, as neither Cyborg nor the Green Lanterns are present but Martian Manhunter (just off his appearance in Snyder's Dark Nights: Metal #5) is; Cyborg was just named team leader in the current Justice League series.\nThe sampler will also include a preview of a new \"fan magazine\" the publisher is launching, called DC Nation. Borrowing the name from a DC/Cartoon Network initiative a few years ago, DC Nation #1 is scheduled for release June 6.\nDC Nation #0 is set for release May 2, meaning it will be on-shelves for the anticipated large turnaround of readers on May for Free Comic Book Day. For that day, DC has two reprints scheduled. The print edition will cost readers 25\u00a2, but DC plans to offer it for free digitally.",

        "text": "Image\nCreditSonny Figueroa/The New York Times\nAfter a career spent editing zeitgeist-tilting writers like Hunter S. Thompson and Tom Wolfe, tapping the journalist Joe Hagan to write his biography \u201cwas essentially Jann Wenner\u2019s last great assignment,\u201d Hagan observes in an afterword to \u201cSticky Fingers: The Life and Times of Jann Wenner and Rolling Stone Magazine,\u201d and \u201cthere was no way in hell I was going to screw it up.\u201d\nScrew it up Hagan did, according to Wenner , who has called the final product \u201cdeeply flawed and tawdry.\u201d The Rolling Stone publisher had apparently hoped for a biography that was the equivalent of a marble bust to position in the foyer of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland (another Wenner production) \u2014 sanitized, full of kumbaya generational feeling and as uplifting as the chorus of a power ballad.\nWhether Wenner can see it or not, his bet has paid off: Hagan has delivered a supple, confident, dispassionately reported and deeply well-written biography. It\u2019s a big book, one that no one will wish longer, but its chapters move past like a crunching collection of singles and not a thumb-sucking double album. It\u2019s a joy to read and feels built to last.\nHagan is among those relatively rare biographers who keeps macro and micro in yin-yang balance. He\u2019s in command of the big picture. The critic and intellectual in him understands why a mere rock magazine editor \u2014 Wenner founded Rolling Stone in San Francisco in 1967 \u2014 matters to the history of the 20th century.\nHere was the egotistical fanboy who had \u201clegitimized and mainstreamed\u201d the counterculture in the 1960s and early \u201970s. You might buy a copy of Rolling Stone simply to ogle a superstar or to find out if Jerry Garcia was still dating Mountain Girl. But as the magazine began to filter out across America, it let a lot of lonely people discover that there were other people like them and other ways to live.\nOver the ensuing decades, Hagan writes, Wenner assembled \u201can entire American cosmology of superstars and superstar journalists, stories, and myths, all fired in the kiln of his appetites and ambition. Millions had dreamed on his pages. Bruce Springsteen said Rolling Stone changed his life. Patti Smith found liberation in Rolling Stone.\u201d\n\u201cSticky Fingers\u201d is about promises and promises betrayed, and about how Wenner\u2019s life \u2014 his increasing obsession with fame and a plutocratic lifestyle \u2014 reflected both.\nImage\nJann and Jane Wenner, in 1970.CreditRobert Altman\nThe visions the rock culture had once delivered \u201chad morphed into the Me Decade,\u201d Hagan writes, \u201cand the Me Decade had turned into Me Decades, and finally the falcon could no longer hear the falconer, not even in the pages of Rolling Stone.\u201d\nWenner and our current president are the same age, and Hagan draws a straight line between them. \u201cThe solar eclipse of Donald Trump signaled the complete triumph of celebrity culture over every aspect of American life,\u201d Hagan writes, and Wenner helped lead us to the state we are in.\nCome for the essayist in Hagan, stay for the eye-popping details and artful gossip. Wenner has complained about how much of that gossip is focused on his changeful sexual appetites. Wenner has slept for much of his life with men and women and thus, to paraphrase Woody Allen on the upside of bisexuality, has rarely lacked a date for Saturday night.\nHagan could easily have named-dropped his way through this book, yet he doesn\u2019t drop names so much as pick them up and coolly appraise them in a line or two. Here\u2019s Joni Mitchell, \u201cplucking a dulcimer and ululating.\u201d Or the record executive Ahmet Ertegun, \u201cwith the half-lidded ease of a beat poet.\u201d Or Thompson, who \u201cmumble-grumbled like a character actor from a Bogart movie.\u201d Or Keith Richards, \u201clooking as if his face were roasted for a Thanksgiving dinner.\u201d\nRichards has become the Gore Vidal of rock, the elder statesman always armed with an acid quote. He says about Wenner and Mick Jagger (this book floats the possibility that the two slept together): \u201cThey\u2019re both very guarded creatures. You wonder if there\u2019s anything worth guarding.\u201d\nWenner founded Rolling Stone with money borrowed from the family of his soon-to-be wife, Jane Schindelheim, after dropping out of Berkeley. A famous early cover featured a naked John Lennon and Yoko Ono. \u201cPrint a famous foreskin,\u201d Wenner wrote in the next issue, \u201cand the world will beat a path to your door.\u201d\nThe staffers at Rolling Stone tended to sleep together, and often enough with Wenner, according to Hagan\u2019s account. Wenner developed an outsize cocaine habit; writers and staffers were sometimes paid bonuses with the drug. When the staff stayed en masse in a hotel, the management couldn\u2019t figure out, the next day, why all the mirrors were off the wall and on their backs.\nImage\nJoe HaganCreditSamantha Hunt\nAs rock music faded in importance, Rolling Stone got a lift from Wolfe and Thompson and became, in many ways, the beating heart of New Journalism. Annie Leibovitz made the magazine\u2019s images as vital as its writing.\nAfter Wenner himself, Leibovitz is the most fully realized character in this biography. She comes across as an endearing wild child, sleeping with some of her subjects, abandoning rental cars in haste at airports and becoming, Hagan writes, a \u201cfull-blown drug addict whose body was, more than once, unceremoniously dumped in front of a hospital by her dealer.\u201d\nIn the decades that followed the \u201970s, Rolling Stone made money but largely ceased to matter. Hagan charts the way that Wenner, in some of his employees\u2019 estimation, sold out to record companies, and the way he allowed his favorite artists to control what was written about them.\nWenner had a heart attack and broke a hip in June. He has put his controlling share of Rolling Stone up for sale. The magazine itself had grown perilously thin, even before it was rocked by a discredited story about a rape at a University of Virginia fraternity.\nWenner comes off in \u201cSticky Fingers\u201d as a narcissist, a bully, a seducer and a betrayer, and a troubled soul. Feuds with countless people \u2014 Lennon, Paul Simon, Greil Marcus, the promoter Bill Graham \u2014 are recounted. He also led a big life that was packed with incident and frequently even joy. \u201cThe alchemy of his appetites,\u201d Hagan writes, is what made him a great editor in chief.\nThis book lays those appetites bare. In scorning Hagan\u2019s work, Wenner\u2019s editorial antennae have failed him. He had the nerve to select a writer and not a hagiographer, and the decision, at the end of his long career, looks good on him. At times this book will help future generations remember Wenner the way he\u2019d like to be remembered. He told his son Theo, Hagan writes, \u201cPut Hunter\u2019s name on my tombstone, not Brad Pitt\u2019s.\u201d\nFollow Dwight Garner on Twitter: @DwightGarner .\nSTICKY FINGERS\nThe Life and Times of Jann Wenner and Rolling Stone Magazine\nBy Joe Hagan\nIllustrated. 547 pages.

Credit Dado Galdieri for The New York Times\nRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 For teachers in this seaside megacity, Rio de Janeiro\u2019s surge in violence has meant making a life-or-death judgment call with unnerving frequency: deciding whether to cancel classes because of nearby shootouts.\nFor police officers, it has meant burying 119 of their own so far this year and surrendering ever more territory to drug gangs that have resumed open-air sales in teeming communities that had been declared \u201cpacified\u201d just a few years ago.\nMany ordinary residents of this city of about 6.5 million start the day scanning mobile apps that track live reports of gunfire before planning their commutes.\nA little more than a year since Rio de Janeiro hosted a largely successful Summer Olympics, Brazil\u2019s showcase city is plagued by a rise in lawlessness reminiscent of its darkest periods in the 1980s and 1990s. There were 4,974 people killed in Rio de Janeiro State, with a population of about 16.5 million, during the first nine months of this year, up 11 percent from last year, according to state government statistics.\nThe rise in violent crime here is part of a nationwide trend that experts say has been exacerbated by Brazil\u2019s economic recession, by corruption that has hollowed out government coffers and by fierce competition among drug trafficking organizations.\nLast year, there were 61,619 people killed across Brazil, according to data compiled by Brazilian Forum on Public Security , making it the deadliest year on record .\nFacing a budget deficit and increasingly well-armed and organized drug cartels, officials in Rio de Janeiro have turned to the federal government for a bailout and to the military for backup.\n\u201cThe situation is one of complete vulnerability,\u201d said Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Costa, the head of Rio de Paz , an organization that supports victims of violence. \u201cThe weapons used by the traffickers are weapons of war.\u201d\nThe resurgence of violence comes after what had been tangible, but short-lived gains in reducing the city\u2019s crime.\nContinue reading the main story\nPhoto\nThe federal government has deployed hundreds of soldiers to try to contain the violence in the city of Rio de Janeiro.

Credit Dado Galdieri for The New York Times\nIn 2008, when Brazil was preparing to host the 2014 World Cup, and was bidding for the 2016 Olympics, government officials launched an ambitious plan to secure the city\u2019s favelas, a patchwork of unplanned hillside communities that had long been neglected by the government. A system of community policing was established and law enforcement officers were rewarded when they met crime reduction targets.\nIt amounted to a counterinsurgency strategy. So-called Pacification Police Units established in the favelas were envisioned as the first step to bringing state services to the areas. A steady police presence was supposed to root out the organized crime networks that had become the de facto authority in the favelas, and then the plan called for gradually expanding access to decent sanitation, health care and education to the historically marginalized communities.\nFor a few years, the plan appeared to get traction. From a peak of 65 violent deaths per 100,000 Rio de Janeiro State residents in 1994, the rate dropped to 29 in 2012. A $10.7 billion investment in infrastructure before the 2016 Games brought hope that the Olympics would serve as a catalyst to reduce inequality in a city where exorbitant wealth and destitution had long coexisted in stark contrast.\nThe main reason that didn\u2019t happen can be summed up in one word, according to Monica de Bolle, an expert on Brazil at the Peterson Institute for International Economics: Corruption.\n\u201cTo the extent that you were reclaiming territories of the favelas from drug traffickers, you needed to create jobs,\u201d Ms. de Bolle added. \u201cThere was an expectation that there was going to be a massive investment in social projects in the favelas, and then the money ran out completely.\u201d\nThe state-run oil giant Petrobras, based in Rio de Janeiro and one of the city\u2019s economic engines, was crippled by the disclosure of an enormous kickback scheme in 2014. That scandal unfolded as the global price of oil fell precipitously. Simultaneously, according to federal prosecutors, state officials, including the former state governor S\u00e9rgio Cabral, turned spending on the Olympics into an exercise in fraud that allowed senior government officials and businessmen to siphon hundreds of millions of dollars from the public treasury.\nWhile the Olympics led to durable gains for Rio de Janeiro \u2014 most notably by upgrading its public transportation system \u2014 missed opportunities are evident in virtually every part of the city.\nThe C.E. Cl\u00f3vis Monteiro high school in Jacarezinho, in northern Rio de Janeiro, bears a \u201cRio 2016\u201d plaque with the Olympic logo that says \u201cEducation transforms.\u201d\nContinue reading the main story\nPhoto\nA drug gang soldier at his post in an area of northern Rio de Janeiro.

Credit Dado Galdieri for The New York Times\nBut ask the principal, Andreia Queiroz, about the area\u2019s recent transformation, and you get a tour of bullet holes in her building, including one that shattered a classroom window.\nThis year, Ms. Queiroz has often started her morning before dawn scanning reports about gun battles, relying on a series of group chats she monitors on WhatsApp. Deciding when to shut down the school is more art than science, a grim ritual she and other educators across the city have become accustomed to.\nThrough late October, there had been only 11 days this year in which at least one school in the city was not shut down as a result of violence, according to Rio de Janeiro\u2019s municipal education system. That has meant that more than 161,000 students have had their studies interrupted by clashes.\nMs. Queiroz said the breakdown of security and the economic downturn had led as many as 400 of the 1,500 students enrolled in her school to stop coming to class regularly this year.\n\u201cHere we have some students providing for their families,\u201d she said. The ones who continue to come are often jumpy, she added. \u201cI see their difficulty in concentrating,\u201d she added. \u201cThey are here, but their head is always outside.\u201d\nA scan of the school\u2019s walls reveals hints of the violence raging outside \u2014 and the manner in which it is shaping national politics.\nContinue reading the main story\nPhoto\nRelatives and friends at the funeral of Samir da Silva Oliveira, a police officer killed while patrolling in Rio de Janiero.

The second is a repudiation of a far-right congressman, Jair Bolsonaro \u2014 currently polling second in next year\u2019s presidential contest \u2014 who has vowed to empower security forces to kill more of what he calls \u201cbandits.\u201d\nThe front lines for the type of crackdown Mr. Bolsonaro has promised are forming in the neighborhood outside the school.\nOn a recent afternoon, young men armed with rifles stood at the entry points of a sector of Jacarezinho controlled by drug traffickers. Schoolchildren walked home zigzagging through clogged, narrow streets, where produce stands share sidewalk space with tables where sellers hawked small bags of cocaine and marijuana.\nSeveral walls in the community are spattered with deep holes from blasts of ammunition sprayed by machine guns.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the crossfire,\u201d said Maria, a 63-year-old woman who does nails at a tiny salon with bare light bulbs and declined to provide her last name because of security concerns. \u201cI\u2019ve lost lots of business.\u201d\nContinue reading the main story\nPhoto\nAn alley pockmarked with bullet holes in the Jacarezinho neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro.

Credit Dado Galdieri for The New York Times\nA poll conducted by the research firm Datafolha in early October found that 72 percent of Rio de Janeiro residents would move to a safer city if they could. The survey , which included 812 respondents and had a four percentage point margin of error, found that fewer than one in 10 people felt the military police, the main entity responsible for security, were efficient at preventing crime.\nOrdinary residents here speak with similar despondence about the police and the drug gangs.\nAna Paula Oliveira, a community activist whose 19-year-old son was killed by the police in 2014, said residents of low-income communities feel besieged every time the police crack down temporarily, only to ultimately fade away and allow areas to fall back under the control of traffickers. Between January and September, at least 800 of the people killed in the state were shot by police officers.\n\u201cThey come to us with a discourse that there is a war,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this is not a war. It\u2019s a massacre of poor people living in favelas. In order to ensure that the elite enjoys security, it\u2019s necessary to kill the poor people.\u201d\nUpscale parts of Rio de Janeiro, including the tourist hubs like Copacabana and Ipanema, feel like a world apart, thanks to a robust police presence. But they have not been spared by the rise in crime. And the violence has taken a steep toll on the tourism industry.\nThe city lost approximately $200 million in tourism revenue between January and August, according to the National Federation of Commerce, Goods, Services and Tourism. Two tourists have been shot so far this year in the city, including a Spanish woman who was killed by a policeman last month while she was touring a favela.\nWhile security in Brazil has historically been a state and municipal government responsibility, the federal government in recent months has deployed hundreds of soldiers to contain outbursts of violence in Rio de Janeiro. In a sign that the military is bracing for a prolonged role here, it successfully lobbied Congress last month to pass a law allowing soldiers who commit crimes against civilians during operations to be tried in military tribunals, rather than civilian courts.\nRoberto S\u00e1, the secretary of security for Rio de Janeiro State, said in response to emailed questions that the \u201cfinancial calamity\u201d that had afflicted the state over the last year and a half had made it impossible to implement a comprehensive security policy.\n\u201cTo put it in practice,\u201d Mr. S\u00e1 said, \u201cwe need financial resources that the state does not have at its disposal.\u201d\nContinue reading the main story\nPhoto\nA government plan to reclaim Rio de Janeiro\u2019s favelas from drug traffickers collapsed when money to invest in infrastructure was siphoned off by corrupt officials.

        "text": "Cloud Hill abandons controversial project for Nashville's Greer Stadium\nAfter months of criticism from historic preservationists and increasing political blowback for Mayor Megan Barry, the development team behind Cloud Hill \u2014 the much-disputed mixed-use plan for Nashville's Greer Stadium site \u2014 withdrew its controversial proposal Friday.\nThe abrupt retreat was announced in a statement by lead developer Bert Mathews that called the project \"more complex than anticipated\" and no longer viable to pursue.\nIt came as the mayor's office said a final archaeological review of the former minor league baseball stadium found it is \"highly likely that human remains are still present\" on portions of the city-owned site.\nHistorical records indicate they could be graves of slaves who built the Civil War-era Fort Negley, which is uphill from the abandoned stadium.\nBarry: Greer future should honor Fort Negley history, bring community together\nBarry, who had supported Cloud Hill, said the future of the Greer property now needs to better honor those who died building the fort \u2014 matching a demand pushed by those who have led the fight against Cloud Hill.\n\u201cThe likelihood of graves means that we should reassess plans for this site so as to better honor and preserve the history of the men and women who died in the construction of a fort that helped save the Union,\u201d Barry said in a statement timed with Cloud Hill's announcement.\n\u25baMore: Mayor's office met with Cloud Hill a year before city kicked off Greer Stadium redevelopment\n\u25baMore: Archaeologists: \u2018High likelihood of human remains\u2019 at Greer Stadium\n\u201cAs we move forward, I want to see that whatever happens with the Greer Stadium site will honor that history, while bringing the community together around a shared vision,\" she added. \"I have faith in the ability of all stakeholders to work together to identify and coalesce around this vision.\u201d\nMathews, who had teamed with music producer T Bone Burnett and financier Tom Middleton on the project, said Cloud Hill was designed to \"rethink the way we build communities.\"\nCloud Hill developer: 'Our proposal is no longer viable'\nBut he pointed to the complexities in developing the \"extremely challenging site\" as well as Metro's archaeological study, which he seemed to raise questions about.\nMore: Kix Brooks jumps into fight against Cloud Hill project at Nashville's Greer Stadium\n\u201cIt has become clear that several issues, including the appropriate yet still uncertain approach to archaeology based on the recent report released by the city, have become more complex than anticipated,\" Mathews said. \"We have, therefore, concluded that our proposal is no longer viable and must be withdrawn.\n\u201cWe sincerely hope that Greer will become a place that serves the many diverse needs and interests of the surrounding neighbors and residents, and in which people from every neighborhood in Nashville will be welcome and safe 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\"\nCloud Hill, which was planned as a mix of artist and music space, housing, retail and park space near the budding Wedgewood-Houston neighborhood, was awarded an intent to contract by the city in May. The Barry administration had delayed moving forward on the project amid the city's archaeological study, first announced in August. The plan still required Metro Council and parks board approval.\n\u25ba More: Cloud Hill developer pushes back at preservationists' criticism\nBurnett had characterized Cloud Hill as a legacy project \u2014 \"my baby,\" he called it \u2014 that had been on his radar for the last couple of years.\nTalks between the mayor and the Cloud Hill team went back to 2015, more than a year before Metro started accepting proposals for the site.\n'It shows you can fight city hall,' councilman says\nBut despite backing by a heavyweight team, the project was met with swift resistance from the outset that only widened over time.\nCritics questioned the financing of the proposed 99-year lease deal, which would have had Cloud Hill's development team pay just $1 million over 10 years and pump $7 million in infrastructure upgrades into property appraised at $31.8 million by Metro. The developers would have collected 70 percent of the net cash flow from the site, with Metro taking in 30 percent.\n\u25baMore: How much is Nashville's Greer Stadium property worth? Proposed deal under scrutiny\nThe Greer site, part of the original Fort Negley Park campus, also became the subject of a battle cry for historic preservation activists and park advocates who demanded that the land be reclaimed as park space that could be used by the public.\nCloud Hill opponents called the public land \"hallowed ground\" that should not be transferred to private development. Cloud Hills leaders had vowed to honor the site appropriately and not build if and where graves were found.\n\"It's a victory for Nashville's volunteer citizen army of historians, park advocates and neighbors who've proven that it's everybody's job to protect this city's great treasures,\" said at-large Councilman John Cooper, who led the fight from the council. \"It shows you can fight city hall.\"\nArchaeology report recommended portion of site be protected, reintegrated into park\nThe Tennessean reported on a preliminary archaeology study by Tennessee Valley Archaeological Research last month that found a high likelihood of human remains on the Greer site.\nAn updated final report, after more advanced trenches and shoveling, released Friday found that, despite multiple construction projects on the site over the years, multiple areas still contain intact human-created archaeological deposits.\n\u25baMore: Alternative vision floated for Greer Stadium property: a city park\nThe new report recommends a portion of the area proposed for Cloud Hill \"be protected with no land alteration taking place\" and that it be \"reintegrated into Fort Negley Park.\"\nFort Negley, built atop St. Cloud Hill from 1862 to 1864 during the Union Army\u2019s occupation of Nashville, was constructed by some 2,700 slaves and free slaves. Hundreds are believed to have perished because of harsh conditions, and they are believed to be buried on the hillside.\nThe fort is considered the only stone inland fort used during the Civil War. But the fort has been largely neglected by the city, and forgotten by many for most of the past century.\nCloud Hill overcame a protest from a rival development bid, led by Devinder Sandhu, who argued the city unfairly awarded the bid.\nIn recent months, more than 4,700 people signed an online petition urging the city turn Greer, the former home of the Nashville Sounds, into urban park space.\n\u25baMore: 'Nashville Nine' now just one: Preservationists go all-in for Fort Negley\nAnd in an unprecedented move, the preservationist group Historic Nashville Inc. recast its annual \"Historic Nine\" listing of endangered properties into the \"Nashville One\" \u2014 Fort Negley.\n\"In this time, this weird political age we live in, right really did triumph over politics and power,\" said author and preservationist Robert Hicks of Franklin, who opposed the development.\n\"Now, this is our responsibility,\" he said. \"We need to be sure that it doesn't fall back into a state of neglect \u2014 that once Greer is gone and the parking lots are gone, that money and time is spent.\"\nCloud Hill latest controversial project cleared off mayor's plate\nCouncilman Colby Sledge, who represents the Greer Stadium area, in an email to constituents said he's \"disappointed that the Cloud Hill proposal didn't work out.\" He called the project a \"unique solution\" to challenges in his district such as affordable housing, accessible green space and commercial facilities for creative makers.\nSledge said he learned a great deal about Fort Negley, and its place in Nashville's African-American history, during this process, and that he's \"still learning.\" He said he supports the new educational initiatives at the fort, adding that the communities around it \"deserve to enjoy this site, to learn from it, and to take ownership and pride in it.\"\n\"I also hope that everyone who cares about this property will come together quickly to start working toward a solution,\" he said. \"The worst possible outcome now would be a Greer Stadium site that continues to sit and rot.\"\n\u25baMore: Mayor Megan Barry delays closure of inpatient care at Nashville General Hospital\nFor Barry, the Cloud Hill decision means she has stepped back from controversial projects on back-to-back days.\nOn Thursday, the mayor announced plans to delay a decision on ending inpatient care at Nashville General Hospital, a proposal that also had been roundly scrutinized. It comes as the mayor is seeking passage of a controversial referendum on funding for a $5.4 billion transit project on May 1.\nBarry, who has been a staunch proponent of the Cloud Hill development, said the project was a plan that \"even critics thought would be a welcome addition to the community, if perhaps at another site.\"\nShe said she regrets the city won't be able to move forward with the project but thanked the Cloud Hill team for \"stepping up and helping us see what a sustainable, responsible, and equitable development could look like on this land.\u201d\nReach Joey Garrison at jgarrison@tennessean.com or 615-259-8236 and on Twitter @Joeygarrison.",

        "text": "\u2018My Hands Were Tied\u2019: How Readers Handled Unethical Workplace Requests\nImage\nBy Brianna Milord\nJuly 18, 2017\nAfter an article providing advice for dealing with workplace ethics dilemmas , The New York Times asked readers to share their stories of times when they were explicitly asked to deceive clients, hide misconduct or engage in behavior that violated their principles.\nHere are some of those stories, which have been edited and condensed for clarity and style.\n\u2018I was asked not to serve the homeless man on the corner of the street\u2019\nSome people shared stories about being told to refuse service to particular people or to discriminate against colleagues.\nI was asked to treat my female employees and male employees differently and likewise white and minority differently. These were explicit directives. I explained why I couldn\u2019t legally do that and was left to go about the business of business. The outcome was correct, but the taste in my mouth was bitter.\n\u2014Ryan Kargel on The New York Times\u2019s Facebook page\nI was asked not to serve the homeless man on the corner of the street even though he saved his pennies to come in and buy some coffee. The managers didn\u2019t want him stinking up the bakery. So during my shifts, I ushered him and served him cookies, macarons, ice cream \u2014 whatever he wanted. I was fired shortly after.\n\u2014Ella Lorenzo on The New York Times\u2019s Facebook page\nA former supervisor told me that I needed to hire more staff who \u201creflected the demographic of our clientele\u201d and to \u201cget rid of some staff\u201d who had been working there for a while by \u201cwriting them up for every little thing.\u201d I was the director of a high-end child care center in a ritzy neighborhood.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t live with it if someone ended up with food poisoning\u201d\nSome people recalled times when they were told to lie to trick customers.\nI worked at an elevator/escalator company in the late \u201880s. I maintained the database of all the service calls. Some person was injured on one of the company\u2019s escalators, and my boss asked me to pull all the service call details for that specific escalator. One of the service logs described the escalator as \u201cdangerous.\u201d My boss told me to delete the word \u201cdangerous\u201d from the log. I was a kid just starting out. What could I do? I deleted it.\n\u2014David Brooks on The New York Times\u2019s Facebook page\nWe have been ordered to change stickers so the deodorants of our company would look like the famous ones. The whole office was doing it for two weeks or longer: ripping off actual stickers and sticking on the new ones. For me it felt horrible! But it appeared to me they already had been doing that before. I was a newbie there at the time, and I needed money. I could not afford to quit. I feel ashamed even now, and it happened 16 years ago.\n\u2014Olga Dmitrieva on The New York Times\u2019s Facebook page\nI worked in a campus cafe in college. One day, my boss handed me a spreadsheet of refrigerator temperatures and asked me to fill it in for the past week \u201cjust random enough to make it look real.\u201d I said yes at first, hemmed and hawed for a little while, then ultimately gave it back to him and said I couldn\u2019t live with it if someone ended up with food poisoning. He played it cool, but for a 20-year-old, it was nerve-racking.\n\u2014Bethany Scott on The New York Times\u2019s Facebook page\nA company I used to work for forced me to install pirated copies of Microsoft Office and other productivity tools, circumventing the trial offers they had with key generators. My hands were tied because they were sponsoring my J-1 visa, and I did not want to leave the country.\n\u2014Edwin Ortega on The New York Times\u2019s Facebook page\nThe supervisor wouldn\u2019t fire a nurse that was stealing medicine.\nSome readers recounted being asked to cross ethical boundaries in the medical field and chose to speak out.\nWe had a hospice nurse who was pickpocketing patient meds. Our supervisor said she couldn\u2019t fire her because we didn\u2019t have enough nurses. I threatened to turn them both in to the nursing board. Finally, she fired that nurse.\n\u2014Carole Marmell on The New York Times\u2019s Facebook page\nA doctor asked me to keep a brain-dead 89-year-old alive even if I had to do CPR on her. I refused and told him so. Then he told me I had to do whatever he ordered. I responded, \u201cUm, no, I don\u2019t have to do anything illegal, immoral or unethical.\u201d I was removed from her care. I reported it, and within 10 minutes, she was declared a do-not-resuscitate.\n\u2018Sometimes, you just have to stand your ground\u2019\nSome people shared stories of refusing to accept requests from their bosses.\n\u201cOne of my bosses asked me to spy on my co-workers. I said, \u201cif one of the higher-ups asked me to report on her, how would she feel about that?\u201d She didn\u2019t like my answer. Growing up the way I did, I knew not to spy and report on people. That was not what I was hired to do. Sometimes you just have to stand your ground, no matter what the consequences are, and trust it will work out to your best interest. Know that kind of reputation will follow you, and not even a person in the position of authority can trust you if that\u2019s how you operate.\u201d",

        "text": "See more\nThe consonants are more regular than first appears. The English pronunciations use a modified form of the system handed down from Latin. \u201cStop\u201d consonants\u2014those that stop the airflow entirely\u2014get an\u00a0ee\u00a0sound after them. (Think B, D, P and T.) Consonants with a continuing airflow get an\u00a0e-as-in-egg\u00a0sound at the beginning instead (F, L, M, N, S, X). There are a couple of exceptions. C and G have both stop and non-stop (\u201chard\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d) sounds, as seen in \u201ccat\u201d and \u201ccent\u201d, and \u201cgut\u201d and \u201cgin\u201d. They are called\u00a0see\u00a0and\u00a0gee\u00a0because in Latin they were only \u201cstop\u201d consonants and so follow the same naming rules as B and D. (Why they are not pronounced\u00a0key\u00a0and ghee\u00a0is unclear.)\nOther anomalies require a bit more explanation. R, which has a continuing airflow, used to conform to the rule above, and was called\u00a0er. Its vowel changed to\u00a0ar\u00a0for unknown reasons. V was used as both a consonant and a vowel in Latin, and so does not fit the pattern above either: it is a fricative (a consonant in which noise is produced by disrupting the airflow), named like a stop.\u00a0Double-U\u00a0is a remnant of V\u2019s old double-life, too. J did not exist in Latin; its English pronunciation is inherited from French, with some alternation.\u00a0Zed\u00a0comes from the Greek\u00a0zeta. (Americans call it\u00a0zee,\u00a0perhaps to make it behave more like the other letter-names, though the exact reason is unclear.) And\u00a0aitch\u00a0is perhaps the greatest weirdo in the alphabet. Its name is descended from the Latin\u00a0accha,\u00a0ahha\u00a0or\u00a0aha, via the French\u00a0ache.\u00a0The modern name for the letter does not have an h-sound in it, in most places. But there is a variant\u2014haitch\u2014thought by some to be a \u201chypercorrection\u201d, an attempt to insert the letter\u2019s pronunciation into its name. In the Irish republic,\u00a0haitch\u00a0is considered standard; in Northern Ireland, it is used by Catholics, whereas\u00a0aitch\u00a0is a shibboleth that identifies Protestants. But it is not limited to Ireland:\u00a0haitch\u00a0is also spreading among the English young, to the horror of their elders.",

Its services include media and communications training, presentation coaching, and message development.\nAsked to describe the clients in terms of sector, Jenkins responded, \"It really runs the gamut. I'm building my client base now and will be talking to folks I've worked with in the past and new folks as well.\"\nJenkins added that he has been in talks with people in the San Francisco Bay Area for the past two weeks to \"gauge interest\" for \"business development purposes.\" He explained that the firm isn't in expansion mode yet, but there are \"some folks [he] would love to think about bringing on when the time is right.\"\n\"I want to get established in the Bay Area initially,\" Jenkins said.\nAt Alibaba, Jenkins was a director, serving on the comms, strategy, and planning team. He was part of the group that created the messaging framework and global communications framework as the Alibaba entered the world market. He joined Alibaba in 2014.\n\"While I'm grateful to Alibaba for the opportunity to be part of such an amazing company, [executive coaching] has always been a passion of mine,\" Jenkins said. \"The opportunity was certainly there but it wasn't the focus of what I was there to do. I've been focusing on building out Alibaba's influencer program, which was about identifying key audiences and finding ways to keep them informed.\"\nLeaving Alibaba at the end of September to start North Bay, Jenkins follows the lead of Jim Wilkinson, who was head of international corporate affairs before exiting the company earlier this year to start TrailRunner International. TrailRunner handles consulting work for Alibaba.\nWilkinson's replacement was Jennifer Kuperman, who spoke with PRWeek in April about Alibaba's strategy is to help businesses outside China access the country's market .\n\"[Jenkins] made many contributions to Alibaba during his tenure and we wish him the best with his new firm,\" Kuperman said.\nPrior to joining Alibaba, Jenkins was a director at Brunswick Group. He worked at the White House as director of the office of global communication and, most recently, as deputy assistant to the president. He was a special assistant in the George W. Bush administration.\nThe first firm Jenkins started was Frontier International Communications, a Washington, D.C.-based shop. Clients included GE, the Lance Armstrong Foundation, McCain '08, and the San Antonio Spurs, according to Jenkins' LinkedIn profile.\n\"I will certainly bring my experiences with Alibaba and China's market to my coaching,\" Jenkins said. \"But the coaching I will be focusing on primarily is not business development -- it's about communication.\"\nThis article was updated on October 21 to correct Jenkins' career history and his responsibilities at Alibaba.",

DiBiasi doubled the lead and notched her second goal of the night in the 26th minute after Catarina Macario\u2019s cross found the attacker to slot it past the goalkeeper.\nStanford will play in the College Cup final on Sunday against the winner between Duke and UCLA.\nSIGN UP\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time for this program.

They\u2019ve accomplished great things.

        "text": "Photograph by Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images.\nIn the middle of 2008, Derek Dukes decided he wanted to help Barack Obama get elected president. He started raising money for the campaign, largely through the Local Lefties mailing list that his girlfriend helped to run in San Francisco\u2019s Mission neighborhood, and regularly visited the campaign\u2019s Market Street office for volunteer shifts. He saw many familiar faces there, either from his time at a Silicon Valley corporate headquarters (Dukes was Yahoo\u2019s sixth employee) or the city\u2019s startup scene (he had left Yahoo to launch the timeline website Dipity). \u201cThere had already been a little mini-collapse, and investment in the Internet pulled back,\u201d says Dukes. \u201cPeople in tech in San Francisco had a lot of free time.\u201d Regardless of their backgrounds, these volunteers were being asked to make phone calls to voters in battleground states. When office organizers realized that Dukes, a technical product manager, had computer fluency, he was given data-entry tasks. \u201cAs a technologist, I thought the tools they were using weren\u2019t very impressive but super-functional. It was obvious they could be doing things smarter and better,\u201d he reflects. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t really involved at a level that I would give feedback or propose changes.\u201d\nLast week, Dukes encountered some of those same faces once again at a party to christen a new Obama \u201ctech field office,\u201d which for a month has been quietly enlisting skilled Bay Area supporters to take on more ambitious work than phone canvassing or data entry. Unlike the hundreds of field offices Obama will eventually open elsewhere in the country, the campaign isn\u2019t inviting walk-ins to its SoMa outpost; volunteers need to demonstrate that they have advanced coding and program-design talents and schedule regular shifts by appointment. The tech team at Obama\u2019s Chicago headquarters hopes to assign them entire projects, and has dispatched a top campaign official, Catherine Bracy, to oversee the satellite facility.\nIn 2008, most innovation was accidental, the result of a perpetually expanding campaign with a surfeit of talent and resources always looking to solve new problems. Much of the core technical work was contracted to outsiders: the web infrastructure to agency Blue State Digital, and the statistical models to Ken Strasma\u2019s firm Strategic Telemetry. Yet this time around, most of those functions (and others) are being carried out by staff in Chicago\u2014with new Silicon Valley-style titles like \u201cchief innovation officer\u201d and \u201cproduct manager\u201d\u2014and boosted with extra help from West Coast volunteers. Just in the last week, the campaign has unveiled a new one-click fundraising protocol via text message and a fresh organizing interface it calls Dashboard.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear they\u2019re putting more effort into building back-end systems in-house this time,\u201d says Jim Pugh, who worked on Obama\u2019s online-analytics team in 2008 and now oversees technology for the lefty advocacy group Rebuild the Dream. \u201cAny presidential campaign, and the Obama campaign in particular, is going to have some very specific requirements. Doing custom design for stuff like that can get them a lot more than would be possible just going through third-party sources or contract work.\u201d\nThose involved in Obama\u2019s campaign are openly optimistic that their innovations will have an impact on the outcome in November, but their private conversations also raise tantalizing questions about what happens after the election. Could the technology developed by Obama's campaign make the president a political power broker for elections to come?\n\u201cIf 2008 was the alpha test, this is beta. There are a lot of good ideas, and a lot of hypotheses will either be proven or disproven in this election through new product development and system improvements,\u201d says Dukes, who has since founded Jetpac, a travel-app startup. \u201cProblems that exist in campaigns are similar to problems that exist elsewhere, and people in tech see the parallels. It\u2019s not clear there\u2019s a $100 million exit option in political technology\u201d\u2014in other words, a large corporation willing to pay top dollar to buy out an entrepreneur\u2019s idea\u2014\u201cbut entrepreneurs in the Valley are starting to look at it.\u201d\nThere is already a clear path to market for technology incubated in the service of electing Obama. As the campaign\u2019s deputy field director in Georgia in \u201908, Aharon Wasserman found himself spending as many as five hours each night collating data on his organizers\u2019 activities\u2014the number of local volunteer teams assembled, canvassing shifts assigned, voters contacted\u2014into a spreadsheet sent to national officials in Chicago. Along with a volunteer, Justin Lewis, Wasserman designed a program to automate many of those reporting and monitoring procedures; eventually, his peers in other states heard about Wasserman\u2019s breakthrough and asked if they could use it, too. \u201cWe weren\u2019t thinking at the time that we were going to develop this for the entire campaign,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were just trying to do something in Georgia.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nAfter the election, Wasserman, Lewis, and a third campaign volunteer, Edward Saatchi, combined to start a firm, National Field, to refine and market their program. In 2009, the Democratic National Committee became an early client, followed by state parties and congressional campaign committees. They began to think of their software as not just a Web-based internal reporting system for organizations, but a Facebook for an org-chart world, adding flourishes like pictures to individual profiles and distinctive features like \u201cups\u201d and \u201cchallenges\u201d designed to engender a sense of competition. \u201cPeople don\u2019t like to report in general, but if you make it feel like a good experience it becomes a place they want to go,\u201d says Wasserman.\nLast month, the 15-employee firm was granted a patent for its \u201chierarchical social network\u201d design and has begun marketing their product to non-campaign clients, like Kaiser Permanente and Great Britain\u2019s National Health Service, and Wasserman sees room for growth in the airline and education sectors. National Field\u2019s identity remains tied up with Obama for America (the re-election campaign is a client), but the president\u2019s political organization has never tried to assert its ownership of a technology incubated by its employees and volunteers on campaign time. \u201cIt never came up,\u201d says Wasserman.\nThis year, however, the campaign already seems to be taking steps to formalize its relationship to the intellectual property being developed in its name. Unlike typical campaign volunteers, those who sign up to help at the San Francisco tech office are required to sign contracts with both nondisclosure and work-for-hire provisions, according to those familiar with the arrangement. But while employment contracts would probably make it easy to stop former staffers from selling the work they did for the campaign, Obama\u2019s lawyers would struggle to prevent a volunteer from doing so. \"It's hard to enforce an agreement where money or other valuable consideration isn't being exchanged,\u201d says Michael Toner, general counsel of George W. Bush\u2019s first presidential campaign. \u201cAs a legal matter, if you had a volunteer on a campaign that came up with some asset that had commercial value it would be hard to bar that person from using it for non-campaign purposes.\"\nEven to enforce employee contracts, Obama for America would have to remain active long after what is likely its figurehead\u2019s final run. It often takes a while for campaign committees to wind down\u2014Bush-Cheney \u201904 didn\u2019t shut its doors until the spring of 2007\u2014but usually they only stick around to settle accounts and comply with audits, not to control property. (Hillary Clinton for President is still paying off its debts.) Committees can\u2019t continue fundraising unless it\u2019s for a specific election, so if Obama were intent on keeping former staffers from getting rich off their campaign work he would need to end this campaign with plenty of money on hand to fund its ongoing activities, including lawyers\u2019 bills.\nAdvertisement\nIf Obama is able to defend his ownership of campaign innovations, what could he do with them? Federal election laws were written to set rules for campaigns getting rid of things like copy machines and desk chairs, bumper stickers and posters, and the occasional pile of unspent cash. Less consideration has been devoted to the intellectual property developed in the service of an election\u2014research binders, polling data, issue papers\u2014which has tended to be worthless immediately after the polls close. The law appears to leave Obama wide latitude if he wanted to constructively liquidate his tech holdings after November: The Federal Elections Commission clearly encourages campaign committees to transfer assets to charitable organizations, which could even include the Barack Obama Presidential Library Foundation. (Such a foundation would be restricted by its own tax status on how the gift could be put to use.)\nThe same rules about winding down committees would probably allow Obama to leave an electioneering legacy by bequeathing his innovations as a sort of tech endowment for future Democratic campaigns. Federal law allows unlimited transfers of assets to party committees, which should mean Obama for America could sign over ownership of a valuable app or the code to a text-messaging protocol to the Democratic National Committee without any issue.\nBut what if Obama wanted to pick and choose which candidates benefited from his tools\u2014like, for example, making sure that Democrats who voted against health care reform were on their own, or that Joe Biden got a boost over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 primaries? The FEC has carved out a specific exemption for campaigns to market one kind of intellectual property that campaigns generate for which there is high demand: their lists of fundraising targets, which can be sold to other campaigns. Would the commission treat a piece of software or a technological breakthrough that resides in a snippet of code the same way? \u201cIf the committee created an asset for its own use, it can sell that asset at fair market value to anyone, including a corporation,\u201d says Neil Reiff, a former deputy general counsel for the Democratic National Committee. \u201cThey could even sell the same asset to more than one entity, like a list.\u201d\nObama for America could probably use the same part of the law to become an off-the-books tech supplier for Democratic candidates. The FEC discourages campaigns from using asset sales to \u201cengage in an ongoing enterprise, rather than an isolated transaction,\u201d but is more open-minded if no cash changes hands. Candidates are permitted to swap their mailing lists with other campaigns, parties, and advocacy groups\u2014as long as the traded items have the same value. Usually these swaps feature similar objects being traded\u2014one group\u2019s fundraising targets for another\u2019s\u2014but what if Obama offered favored 2014 congressional campaigns or Biden for President a yearlong software license in exchange for $5,000 of polling data or opposition research? Because no cash exchanges hands, neither party would be under any obligation to report the arrangement\u2014which means Obama could keep an invisible hand in Democratic campaigns for years.",

Then it's time to clean up your credit.\n(iStock)\nBy Joanna Nesbit\nJanuary 5\nWe all know college is expensive, but most families don't understand true costs until senior year. This is when parents realize their college savings plan, if they have one, won't be enough.\nHowever, if you haven't watched your financial footprint over the years, you might not be well-positioned for optimal borrowing. Assessing your financial house before senior year helps you create a plan and may uncover cash to put aside. According to finance experts, many families don't look hard enough at ways to free up current cash flow for college. But if you anticipate borrowing due to income constraints, here's what finance experts say you need to know.\nStudents should always borrow first. Before you borrow, your student should take available federal direct student loans (a.k.a. Stafford). These loans impose a limit of $31,000 over five years to protect undergraduate students from exorbitant debt burden . Student borrowing also protects parents. Your teen needn't borrow the whole amount, and later, you can even help pay off loans if retirement goals are on track.\n[ 11 misconceptions about paying for college ]\nParents shouldn't overborrow. If student loans don't go far enough \u2014 they often don't \u2014 parents can borrow too. Typical parent borrowing includes taking a federal Parent PLUS loan, co-signing a private student loan , or tapping home equity. Top credit scores (usually 750 or higher) qualify borrowers for low interest rates, says Tim Hewitt, Pennsylvania-based senior financial adviser with Wiley Group. \"That means thousands of dollars saved simply because you manage your credit well,\" he says. Families can also tap retirement accounts. But overborrowing or drawing down retirement funds can be dangerous.\nNannette Kamien, a college-focused financial adviser and owner of Inspiration Financial Planning, says loans are best used as a short-term solution for chunky bills if, for example, the college doesn't offer a payment plan. \"Loans aren't meant to be the primary way to finance college, and parents should consider whether a loan payment is realistic if they're not able to free up income for college bills,\" she says. Many advisers prefer families avoid borrowing beyond student loans, and look at more affordable colleges instead.\nBorrowing is a personal decision that requires thinking about current debt, job stability, your age, and number of kids. Assessing the whole picture is critical before taking loans for that first child, Hewitt says. [3] No matter what college path, polishing your credit score will give you flexibility as you move deeper into college bills and second or third children.\nSteps to repair credit. For a good credit score and access to low interest rates, paying bills on time is key \u2014 and paying the required minimum is imperative, though paying more or in full is best, says Leah Ingram, author of a new book, The Complete Guide to Paying for College . Your \" credit utilization\" ratio also affects credit score. Poorly managed credit cards can do real damage.\nTo monitor credit history, finance experts advise ordering credit reports from all three credit reporting agencies \u2014 Experian, Equifax and TransUnion \u2014 to scour for late or unpaid bills and mistakes, which take time to fix or dispute. [2, 3, 6] Initially, getting all three at once to compare them is best, says Rod Griffin, Experian's director of public education. You're entitled to a free report from each agency once a year (order at annualcreditreport.com ). After that, reports cost $12.50, but free options exist. For Experian, the Experian app provides free credit reports and FICO scores and monitors credit. For TransUnion and Equifax, Credit Karma offers the same.\nCredit reports include anything debt-related, though not every account is reported to all three agencies. These include mortgage loans, auto loans, credit cards, retail services' installment loans, and collection accounts (unpaid bills that go to collections). Rent payments may be reported. Utility, cellphone, and cable bills usually aren't.\nLate payments remain on reports for seven years from the original delinquency date but may not be a big factor. \"The further in the past a delinquency occurred, the less effect it has on your credit score,\" Griffin says. \"But catching up on late payments helps your score recover more quickly even though the late payment stays on your report.\"\nCredit reports don't include credit scores, but purchasing one score report (approximately $15) is a good idea, Griffin says. The report includes your credit score, \"risk factors,\" and actionable steps to repair credit. Scores typically vary across the three agencies, but risk factors tend to be consistent, so ordering one score report is adequate, Griffin says. Then, for ongoing tracking, many credit cards offer free FICO scores.\nIngram recommends tackling credit cleanup starting in middle school to allow time for black marks to fall off by college. Repairing credit anytime benefits you.\nPaying down consumer debt before college also helps, Kamien says, translating into available cash for college. Eliminating debt may also reduce available savings and could improve your financial aid picture. But don't drain savings accounts to qualify for aid. Even if your student qualifies, you'll likely have hefty college bills.\nSeveral ways to borrow. Federal Parent PLUS loans are quite accessible . They can sink you for the same reason. With a fixed interest rate of 7 percent , they help people with mediocre credit scores, and they offer protections , including graduated or extended repayment and dischargement if the parent or student dies. They also include a hefty 4.264 percent origination fee .\nParents with top FICO scores can get better interest rates with private student loans. Ingram's family qualified for 4 percent due to their 801 score. Keep in mind, although technically a student loan, parents typically must co-sign because students don't have qualifying credit history. That means parent credit is on the hook . It's hard to hang onto low interest rates. As Ingram's girls moved through college and she and her husband co-signed additional loans, their interest rates increased.\nTaking a low-interest home equity line of credit (HELOC) might make more sense. A HELOC functions like a credit card in that you borrow only the amount you need as you go. Tying up too much money in college bills means it's not available for home emergencies. Financial advisers also get nervous about adverse events like a job loss. However, if used wisely, Hewitt says, borrowing against equity can be a good choice.\nThe key is to assess finances early, long before that first tuition bill. College is a huge expense, so consider consulting a fee-based financial adviser who understands college. Also, Ingram recommends, begin amassing money a year ahead of the bills, however you intend to pay. Borrowing desperately in August can set you up for financial heartache down the road.\nJoanna Nesbit writes about education, parenting and family travel.

        "text": "In 2011, IBM's (NYSE:IBM) Watson artificial intelligence (AI) supercomputer beat 74-time-straight Jeopardy! champion Ken Jennings in a man-vs.-machine showdown on primetime television. \"Winning\" $77,147 to Jennings' $24,000, Watson arguably proved itself three times as intelligent as his human opponent. In so doing, IBM ushered in the new age of AI, in which humans no longer work for food, and computers do all of our thinking for us.\nOh, wait. That actually didn't happen.\nBut in the six years since Watson beat Jennings on Jeopardy!, IBM's AI wunderkind has been in the news plenty. Among other projects, Watson has been tasked with tackling two of humanity's biggest challenges: helping Pfizer figure out a cure for cancer and navigating the U.S. tax code for H&R Block. Yet what exactly Watson is remains something of a mystery to many. In an attempt to get a better handle on Watson, I posed some questions via email to IBM Vice President Ed Harbour, head of the IBM Watson project.\nHere's what he had to say. (The interview has been edited to aid clarity and brevity).\nRich Smith: What is Watson, exactly? Is it code? Is it servers? What is the clearest way a layman can envision Watson?\nEd Harbour: Watson is the AI platform for business. It is not one thing, but rather a collection of services and capabilities that include machine learning, reasoning, and decision technologies, as well as language, speech, and vision technologies. These capabilities are designed to learn at scale, reason with purpose, and interact with humans naturally to solve a wide range of practical problems, boost productivity, and foster new discoveries across many industries.\nWatson can turn business data -- even data that is unstructured -- into actionable insights that enhance decision-making. Watson can take many forms, from virtual assistant to care manager, research module to customer service agent. Watson leverages the IBM Cloud, offering access to an unprecedented set of enterprise-grade cloud services that can further enhance its function to meet various business needs.\nSmith: How does Watson differ from more familiar forms of AI such as Apple's Siri and Amazon.com's Alexa?\nHarbour: Watson and Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa do totally different things. Their foundation is quite basic and just speech to text to search. Watson delivers a conversation; it delivers answers, alternatives, and evidence-based recommendations with confidence. It learns from interactions and expert training, grows and develops over time. In addition to answers, it offers alternatives and background on why it made the decisions it recommends to users. Watson retains conversations and can understand context and domain. Watson is an AI platform for the enterprise.\nOther forms of AI, like Siri or Alexa, rely solely on Q&A and speech to text. They use pre-compiled, human-curated databases or FAQs to look up keywords, as do search engines like Google. Consumer data is not where most of the value is. Eighty percent of the world's data is not on the Web, but rather embedded in businesses and industries, such as client data, financial data, and medical data. Our approach is to build cognitive solutions to help specific industries and businesses tap this data. A key aspect is Watson protects clients' data and any business insights. This is not shared. Watson is also deployed on the IBM Cloud and can be scaled to meet any enterprise needs.\nFor example, in the case of IBM client H&R Block, Watson was enlisted to understand the \"language\" of tax to provide the most personalized tax-preparation experience. Watson, with the Tax Professional, helped ensure that consumers were getting the best possible tax outcome and also made the entire tax return process a more collaborative, transparent experience. The main differentiator with Watson is the actionable capability and insights it brings to enterprise clients.\nSmith: What would you say is the public's biggest misperception about Watson? What is one thing that folks might think that Watson can do that it actually cannot?\nHarbour: The biggest misperception about Watson is that it's meant to replace humans. Watson works with humans to enhance the abilities of professionals at every level, from highly specialized surgeons to oil drillers, and automates many basic tasks. However, no matter how advanced the technology, some jobs -- specifically, those that rely heavily on empathy, ethical judgment, and social interaction -- will always be performed better by humans.\nCognitive computing introduces a new level of collaboration between man and machine. It will augment and expand human intelligence, not replace it.\nSmith: Can you name one concrete example of something you would like Watson to be able to do that it cannot quite manage yet?\nHarbour: The future of technology is rooted in artificial intelligence. In the next three to five years, you'll see advancements that crack the uniquely human nature of communication. For example, Watson has started to be able to detect facial expressions, to combine words, voice, and visual interfaces and form a complete understanding of a conversation. IBM is also further developing Watson's ability to understand different vocalizations of words and how that reinforces a person's emotional meaning.\nThe true value of Watson and cognitive systems is how it can augment and amplify human abilities. To help us think and perform our jobs better, faster, not to do it for us.\nSmith: How human is Watson right now? Would it be possible for someone to interview Watson about Watson?\nHarbour: Watson is trained on specific data sets to unearth insights into different industries, tasks, and specialties. Once trained, with its speech, language, and intelligence capabilities, Watson can learn and understand the intention behind a specific command and provide a refined answer for the specific industry or profession it was trained to help.\nWhile it's technically possible to train Watson to answer questions about its own technology, unlike humans, Watson does not have a personality, so it may not make for the most engaging interview subject.\nSmith: How does Watson get smarter? By adding data? By refining algorithms? Both?\nHarbour: Watson technologies are trained by humans to understand information specific to different industries, specialties, and languages -- in other words, Watson learns in an expert way, not just a general way. This involves training the system to recognize patterns by feeding it large amounts of labeled data and then working with human experts to refine the answers. Through successive rounds of input and feedback from subject-matter experts, Watson's understanding and responses improve.\nLooking at the implementation of specific Watson technologies -- Natural Language Understanding and Tone Analyzer are designed to allow developers to quickly bake these functionalities into their apps and see value, without a consultant. Watson Conversation Service enables powerful engagement, and Watson Discovery Service allows for unearthing powerful insights often distributed over vast amounts of documents. Even more robust services like Watson Virtual Agent -- a customer-service chatbot -- come pre-trained with over 105 intents and 35,000 utterances and ready for domains such as general customer service, telco, and retail banking. We also built Watson Knowledge Studio, which allows clients to train Watson on the language of their industry, profession, and domain -- easily. We are continually improving and refining the various underlying algorithms that power the Watson platform.\nSmith: How expensive is it for a client to use Watson? How is it billed?\nHarbour: Our approach to delivering Watson is flexible and tailored to the clients with both industry solutions and APIs available on the IBM Cloud.\nWe have several business models for Watson. The overarching theme is value-based. It's really focused on driving scale.\nData Access/Pay Per Insights: The first business model is Pay Per Insight, so every time you touch that data, or you get an insight ... we are paid for the capabilities or insight.\nSubscription: Some companies want to have this capability. A pharma company wants to have this capability for their entire research team, and so they will pay us a subscription for each researcher.\nShare-Value With Partners: So, where our intellectual property, our data comes together with our key partners' data or insight or domain expertise and we create new value to take cost out of the system or improve capability, we share in that value that we create going forward.\nLicensing: A licensing and partnering model around the world.\nSmith: Can you quantify how important Watson is to IBM's business today, in terms of the revenue it produces?\nHarbour: Watson is part of our analytics business in our cognitive-solutions segment. In 2Q17, we reported that revenues in this segment grew to $4.6 billion. Over the last 12 months, our strategic imperatives, which includes analytics, has delivered $34.1 billion in revenue, 43% of IBM's total revenue.\nAnother good indicator of where we are in the cognitive journey is to look at scaling, where we started and where we are now. Watson was just a natural-language machine six years ago. If you want to think of it in terms of a human, it could only \"hear\" or \"read\" and only basic information at that.\nToday, Watson has grown from that one natural-language QA API into a multitude of services. It has gone from simply speaking English to understanding nine languages. We've added more capabilities and have built extensive data sets industry by industry to train Watson to solve complex industry problems.\nIt not only can reason over simple trivia; it can reason through complex industry-specific data, like cybersecurity data or cancer data. And it not only \"reads.\" It can \"see.\" Watson can look at medical images and flag ones for radiologists that are unusual -- and it can understand emotion and tone, too.\nThese capabilities are being deployed in enterprises faster. For example, you mentioned cancer research. Watson took a couple of years to learn about oncology after its Jeopardy! win in 2011. But look where we are today. We've entered clinical use in 12 countries and are expanding to more countries later this year. Watson so far has been trained on six types of cancer, with plans to add several more this year.\nOn taxes, we started with H&R Block last summer. It took us a few months to build a solution for them, and this year somewhere in the ballpark of 11 million people did their taxes at an H&R Block office, powered by Watson.\nAnother metric of success is embedding Watson across the IBM portfolio. That's our mission. We've been describing Watson as a sliver thread, weaving through multiple areas and segments. We're helping colleagues across our portfolio embed Watson into existing offerings. We've been successful in security, commerce, technology services, and systems, to name a few.\nSmith: In addition to cancer and taxes, you are also using Watson to provide individual health and fitness insights to more than 190 million users of Under Armour's connected-fitness platform, while simultaneously providing traffic information to Chevy, Buick, and GMC drivers through General Motors' OnStar service. Is there a limit on the amount of juggling Watson can do, working for so many customers simultaneously?\nHarbour: Each client gets their own \"instance\" of Watson to train with their data, to meet their needs. We can scale to any number by deploying on the IBM Cloud. The applications for this technology are limitless, and we expect to help more than 1 billion people this year.\nWe are continuously working to advance this adoption -- drawing more developers to use cognitive engines like Watson to build their own apps, working with more businesses and industries so they can incorporate cognitive solutions into their workflows.\nSmith: Put Watson in context versus other AIs. How does it stack up against the competition today?\nHarbour: IBM has a significant lead in the industry in applying AI technology, having been researching, developing, and investing in AI technology for more than 50 years. We also have the largest industrial research organization in the world and in 2016 led the industry in AI-related patents held.\nUnlike other technologies in the market today that are in the experimental or elementary stage, Watson is a mature platform making a real impact on the industries it touches. Watson solutions are now being built, used, and deployed in more than 45 countries and across 20 different industries, solving big, complex societal problems, like cancer and cybersecurity. IBM has also made meaningful progress in other industries, ranging from education to commerce.\nSmith: And now look 10 years into the future. What are the chances that in 2027, the average consumer will be able to use Watson in daily life?\nHarbour: There's a chance that you use Watson already. For example, in addition to people taking their W-2s to H&R Block for cognitive interviews, people may be using Watson when ordering office supplies from Staples, interacting with a gift concierge via 1-800-Flowers' Gwyn system, checking auto recall and warranty information via Honda's \"Ask Dave\" interface, or interacting with Harman/IBM-powered smart rooms.\nIn the healthcare space, Watson is about more than just cancer treatment. It's available to more than 200 million patients globally, collaborating with doctors, helping improve treatment recommendations and helping deliver more efficient care.\nAI is playing a bigger and bigger role in consumers' day-to-day lives. By the end of this year, IBM Watson will be available to more than a billion consumers of all kinds, helping them discover the right insurance options, make travel reservations, troubleshoot their IT, answer weather-related questions, get faster service from their bank, and more.",

        "text": "Save\nThe proposed shared-public safety facility in Winterhaven is finally moving forward following a vote to increase the county\u2019s funding for the project by more than $500,000.\nFunding for the shared County Fire and Sheriff\u2019s station in eastern Imperial County would come from $1.5 million grant from the Community Development Block Grants with the county initially committing to contribute an additional $1.8 million.\nIn August the board was presented with a handful of bids that were well beyond the funding available and instructed staff to go back to the drawing board and reduce the scope of work as much as possible in order to bridge the gap in funding.\nDespite the changes made to the project, the county received two new bids that were still more than half a million above their initial $3.3 million budget.\nDue to the urgency to get the project done, the board approved a budget amendment resolution that would allocate $576,000 from criminal justice facilities and road funds in order to award the bid to the lowest bidder, Yuma Valley Contractors.\nCounty Community and Economic Development Director Esperanza Colio told the board that despite the efforts to reduce the cost of construction, the price of steel increased.\nColio urged the board to move forward, as delaying the project could result in even more funding needed as construction cost could go up.\nShe also warned that since the project is using CDBG funds, failure to complete the project in a timely manner could jeopardize future funding the County could be eligible for.\nFor 2018 the county submitted a waiver to the California Department of Housing and Community Development in order to be considered for funds in 2018.\nIn order to be eligible to receive CDBG funding for one year, at least 50 percent of all CDBG monies received in the prior year need to have been used.\nAs most of the funds the county received last year were allocated to the Winterhaven Public Safety Facility, the county didn\u2019t meet that threshold and had to submit a waiver.\nVet Council\nAlso during Tuesday\u2019s meeting, the board voted to move forward with reinstating meetings by the Veterans Advisory Council.\nLast year, veteran groups expressed concern with the Board of Supervisors regarding the lack of meetings from the council and concerns related to county services, such as lack of proper staffing at the County Veterans Service Office.\nDistrict 4 Supervisor Ryan Kelley said the goal is to reactivate the council and have an open line of communication between the council, the VSO and the various veterans groups in the Imperial Valley in order to address some of the primary concerns of the local veterans.\nKelley and District 1 Supervisor John Renison were the two board members that met with local veterans.\nOne of the issues that local veterans have voiced is the limited staffing at the VSO.\nUntil recently the office only had one Veteran Service Officer and one Veterans Service Representative who were tasked to serve local veterans.\nDeputy County Executive Officer Joe Picazo told the board, they recently hired a new representative while another came back.\nHe said the biggest challenge is funding to pay the salaries of staff members and to try to mitigate that the county recently sought a $45,000 from the state that could help offset some of the cost as well as help them with outreach.\n\u201cI appreciate what you want to do for veterans. Many vets, especially the older ones, have been ignored with the benefits they\u2019re supposed to get,\u201d said Frank Pacheco, a Korean War veteran, and commander of the Calexico American Legion Post 90.\nAnother concern the county is looking into resolving is the privacy and confidentiality at the current location, Renison said they have begun to explore the possibility of looking at a better location for the office.\nPicazo added that they have begun having discussions with county departments in hopes of finding a more suitable office space to serve local veterans.\nStaff Writer Edwin Delgado can be reached at edelgado@ivpressonline.com\nStaff Writer Edwin Delgado can be reached at edelgado@ivpressonline.com or 760-337-3440.",

        "text": "At Upton Hill, plans in the works for park improvements\nby SCOTT McCAFFREY, Staff Writer\nNov 29, 2017\nSave\nPlans for development of portions of Upton Hill Regional Park are moving ahead but remain far from finalized, with a number of procedural hurdles to surmount.\n\u201cWe certainly have many more details to work out . . . [but] I think we\u2019re in a very good place. We don\u2019t know of any hiccups,\u201d said Paul Gilbert, executive director of the Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority (NOVA Parks), during a Nov. 28 briefing before Arlington County Board members.\nThe 27-acre park straddles the Arlington-Fairfax line just south of Wilson Boulevard. It has both an active component (with water park, batting cages and miniature-golf course) and natural areas.\nThe proposed upgrades carry an estimated price tag of $3 million, and would include construction of a ropes course, a high-end playground, unstructured play area, paved and surface trails, renovated restroom, seating areas with game tables and a new entrance with additional parking.\nThe good news for Arlington leaders? \u201cThere is no ask for county dollars,\u201d said Clerk of the Circuit Court Paul Ferguson, who with Michael Nardolilli serves as an Arlington representative to the park-authority\u2019s board.\n(Arlington taxpayers do provide a subsidy of about $430,000 a year to support the regional authority, which in addition to Arlington includes facilities in Fairfax and Loudoun counties and the cities of Alexandria, Fairfax and Falls Church.)\nIn order to make the improvements, the park authority will need site-plan approval from the Arlington County government; an OK from the Virginia Department of Transportation for the new entrance off Wilson Boulevard; and the ongoing goodwill of the neighboring Boulevard Manor and Dominion Hills neighborhoods.\nGilbert said his agency has been working with the neighborhoods and county officials since 2015 to develop and revise the plan. \u201cWe will continue to do other engagement as we move forward,\u201d he said.\nCounty leaders seemed on board with the outlines of the proposal. Count Board Chairman Jay Fisette said the regional authority is \u201ca huge asset to Northern Virginia.\u201d\nUnrelated to the development plan, but likely to be welcomed nonetheless: Park officials are planning to provide new artificial turf for the mini-golf course, although there\u2019s no time frame set. The course currently is closed for a winter hiatus.",

        "text": "There's been an explosion in smart home devices over the past few years. What was once referred to as \"home automation\" and still referred to as \"Internet of Things\" has now settled into a more friendly category we call smart home. We've got heating, lighting, cameras, sensors for just about everything, as well as new devices popping up every week to drag your home into a connected future.\nOver the past few years, we've moved from a position of disconnected systems into a world with emerging hubs, with big devices like the Amazon Echo and Google Home acting as hubs to tie all your connected services together, along with emerging platforms like Apple HomeKit and Samsung SmartThings.\nSo what role does ZigBee have to play in this brave new world of the smart home? Pocket-lint is here to supply all the answers.\nThe whole idea behind the smart home it to have everything talking to everything, so you stay informed while you're devices stay informed too. That might be that your lighting talks to your security camera or that your smart coffee machine turns on when you get out of bed. The Internet of Things might be a fairly useless term, but essentially, that's what's happening - everything is connected, meaning that information can be shared and your life can be controlled without the need to visit each thing individually.\nAll of these connected devices are being handled by automatic systems over a single network. The result? You have a smart home, thanks to smart applications and devices. But there's just one problem: many companies make different devices. In order to get them to work together on a single network, you have to use a single common language. That's where ZigBee comes in.\nZigBee is based on the IEEE's 802.15.4 personal-area network standard. All you need to know is that ZigBee is a specification that's been around for more than a decade, and it's widely considered an alternative to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for some applications including low-powered devices that don't require a lot of bandwidth - like your smart home sensors.\nZigBee is for sensor-monitoring and control of various applications/devices from multiple companies, because it lets ZigBee-enabled devices work and operate together while also giving you the ability to control them. Hence why it is ideal for smart homes.\nA typical example is when you own a smart light bulb (that is ZigBee-enabled) and a smart light switch (that is also ZigBee-enabled), and you want the light switch to communicate with and control the light bulb. With ZigBee, the two devices - even if they're from different manufacturers - speak a common language.\nZigBee does not focus on the point-to-point market, such as Bluetooth, where one high-powered device sends data to another high-powered device over a short range. It's also not for standard wireless uses like when you would stream audio or movies.\nYou should only use ZigBee if you need to send data across a large area, where it traverses multiple hops, and all the devices you want to control are low-powered or even battery-powered. For this reason, ZigBee is most used in industrial and smart home systems (such as a wireless light switch for a lighting setup).\nKeep in mind that while ZigBee's network layer supports both star and tree typical networks, it's often associated with a mesh network.\nIn reality, for a customer putting together a smart home, a device that supports the ZigBee protocol may still be siloed, but as we move forward, with more devices wanting to act as the central controller, having fewer wireless protocols for your smart devices might be a distinct advantage - especially if it means you can avoid having a huge collection of hubs connected to your router.\nA mesh network is when a network connection is spread out among wireless nodes that can communicate with each other and share a network connection across a large area. Think of nodes as small radio transmitters that function in the same way as a wireless router. ZigBee's ability to support mesh networking means it can boost data transmission range and provide greater stability (even when a single connected node fails and doesn't work).\nZigBee nodes can be coordinators, routers, and end devices. Coordinators establish the network and store information like security keys, while routers act as intermediate nodes and relay data from other devices. And finally, end devices are low-power gadgets that can communicate with coordinators and routers but cannot transmit data to other end devices.\nIn other words, with ZigBee, you will likely have a master coordinator node that controls other connected nodes. If one node fails for some reason and cannot communicate with a second node on the mesh network, the master node and second node may communicate by linking to a third node within range. Every node acts as a repeater of sorts, and all nodes cooperate in the distribution of data in the mesh network.\nZigBee supports up to 65,000 nodes on a single network.\nPutting this into simple terms, unlike Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, in a mesh network the device doesn't need to connect to the source hub directly, so it steps around the problem of range. Because each device will talk to the others in its mesh, you can string your mesh over a greater difference without the worry of devices not being able to communicate.\nThe ZigBee Alliance was established in 2002. It's a consortium of companies and other organisations that support the development of ZigBee and promote its use. It also performs interoperability testing, certifies products, and maintains the IEEE 802.15.4 standard.\nThere are more than 400 Alliance members and 600 certified products. Members include promoters (such as Philips and Texas Instruments), participants (such as Belkin and AT&T), and adopters (such as Logitech and Motorola Mobility).\nPromoters have representation on the Alliance's Board of Directors and hold voting rights. Participants hold voting rights too but play a more active role in evolving ZigBee and receive early access to specifications for development. Adopters are members that receive access to completed ZigBee specifications and standards.\nSo now you know what ZigBee is, it's worth running through devices that work with ZigBee. Just because they use this standard of wireless networking doesn't immediately mean that things will work in harmony, afterall, you might not have a controlling application that knows what all these devices are.\nHere are some of the big users of ZigBee in the smart home:\nComcast\nHoneywell\nHuawei\nPhilips\nSmartThings\nTexas Instruments\nAmazon\nBelkin\nIkea\nLutron\nNokia\nOsram\nBosch\nIndesit\nSamsung\nVelux\nHumax\nPanasonic\nMiele\nJust because a company uses the protocol, doesn't mean it will instantly play nice, however. Philips Hue uses ZigBee to connect its bulbs, but that doesn't always mean you can add in additional bulbs from a different manufacturer.\nHowever, with the announcement of the Amazon Echo Plus, there's likely to be a big change in how people relate to ZigBee. The new Amazon Echo Plus will be a smart home controller using ZigBee to connect directly to compatible devices, such as Philips Hue lightbulbs.\nYes. There are many alternatives to ZigBee that target the same general applications. Some alternatives are more versatile and be configured for any kind of short-range wireless task, while others are more complex and require longer development times. One of the more notable alternatives is Z-Wave.\nZ-Wave has an alliance, just like ZigBee. The Z-Wave Alliance is a consortium of more than 250 manufacturers that build wireless home control products based on the Z-Wave standard. There are more than 900 different products certified by the Z-Wave Alliance, though that number is constantly growing.\nThere's also another scenario that's tied together smart home devices in recent years. The emergence of Amazon Alexa, Google Home and Apple HomeKit has put in place a controller that is compatible with different systems. While ZigBee devices will notionally understand the wireless protocol that different devices might be using, it's really the open platforms that's currently tying things together. For example, you can enable combinations of products to work together by grouping them with Amazon Alexa, which then pushed out the commands to all the devices, via the cloud.\nIn theory, a central ZigBee controller could communicate directly to devices if it was setup to do so, cutting out the cloud requirement and working on the local network instead.",

        "text": "RIYADH/DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia is taking managerial control of Saudi Binladin Group and discussing a possible transfer of some of the giant construction group\u2019s assets to the state while its chairman and other family members are in detention, sources told Reuters.\nFILE PHOTO: Buildings are seen in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, March 1, 2017. REUTERS/Faisal Al Nasser/File Photo\nBinladin, which had over 100,000 employees at its height, is the biggest builder in the country and important to Riyadh\u2019s plans for large real estate, industrial and tourism projects to help diversify the economy beyond oil.\nHowever, the group has been hurt financially in the past couple of years by a slump in the construction industry and a temporary exclusion from new state contracts after a crane accident killed 107 people at Mecca\u2019s Grand Mosque in 2015. It was forced to lay off thousands of employees.\nRiyadh\u2019s move to take control appears aimed at ensuring the group can continue to serve Saudi Arabia\u2019s development plans, said banking and industry sources, who declined to be named due to the political and commercial sensitivity of the matter.\nThe government detained scores of senior officials and businessmen in October as part of a sweeping crackdown on corruption. The Binladin group\u2019s chairman Bakr Bin Laden and several family members have been held, the sources said.\nSaudi officials are trying to negotiate settlements with detainees, saying they aim to claw back some $100 billion of funds that rightfully belong to the state. The talks on Binladin\u2019s future are part of this effort, the sources said.\nSince the detention of Bin Laden family members, the finance ministry has formed a five-member committee, including three government representatives, to oversee the group\u2019s business and handle relations with suppliers and contractors, the sources said.\nBinladin executives did not respond to phone calls seeking comment. Finance ministry officials and the government media office also did not respond to requests for comment.\nSETTING A PRECEDENT?\nAlthough ownership of Binladin currently remains with the family, the group is in negotiations with the government about the potential transfer of some assets to the state, or possibly reducing or eliminating the government\u2019s outstanding debts to Binladin, the sources said.\nOne banking source with detailed knowledge of the group said the debt might total around $30 billion - the legacy of a period about 18 months ago when the government held off from settling many of its debts as its finances were hurt by low oil prices.\nIt is not clear whether the government\u2019s handling of Binladin may set a precedent for the cases of other businessmen detained in the corruption purge.\nThey include one of the kingdom\u2019s most prominent businessmen, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who is chairman and owner of global investment firm Kingdom Holding 4280.SE.\nBecause of Binladin\u2019s strategic importance to the construction industry and development projects, as well as its financial struggle, it may be treated differently from the assets of other detained suspects.\nThe new management committee\u2019s government representatives include Abdulrehman al-Harkan, a former chief executive of Saudi property company Dar Al Arkan, and Khaled Nahas, a board member of petrochemical producer Saudi Basic Industries Corp, the sources said. There are also two family members on the committee: Yehia Bin Laden and Abdullah Bin Laden.\nPreviously, the family was in total control of the group, with Bakr Bin Laden taking most decisions, the sources said.\nAlthough Osama Bin Laden, the founder of al-Qaeda who was killed by U.S. forces in 2011, was part of the same family, the company did not have any ties to him.",

        "text": "One married couple was responsible for the foundations of modern code breaking, and the principles that gave the NSA a head start in cryptanalysis. Though the husband, William Friedman, is usually apportioned the lion\u2019s share of the credit, his wife Elizebeth Friedman was in every way his equal. During World War II, both worked under total secrecy, and only now are we learning about Elizebeth\u2019s critical work uncovering the secrets of Nazi spies\u2014and cracking the codes of the notorious \u201cDoll Lady\u201d suspected of working for the Japanese.\nVelvalee Dickinson whirled around on the two FBI men and tried to scratch out their eyes. It was January 21, 1944. The agents had staked out the vault at the Bank of New York, waiting for Dickinson to walk in and open her safe-deposit box, and as soon as she did, unlocking a drawer that contained $15,900 in cash, the FBI agents said they had a warrant for her arrest. Dickinson shouted that she didn\u2019t know why. She was fifty years old, a widow, a frail-looking ninety-four pounds, with brunette hair. She made such a kicking commotion that the men had to pick her up by the armpits and carry her away.\nFrom THE WOMAN WHO SMASHED CODES by Jason Fagone. Copyright \u00a9 2017 by Jason Fagone. Reprinted by permission of Dey Street Books, an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers.\nThe FBI arrested Dickinson because of five suspicious letters that had been previously intercepted by postal inspectors and forwarded to the bureau. The letters talked about dolls and the condition of dolls, some of which were damaged: \u201cEnglish dolls,\u201d \u201cforeign dolls,\u201d a \u201cdoll hospital,\u201d and a \u201cSiamese dancer\u201d doll \u201ctore in middle.\u201d The first of the five letters read in part, \u201cYou asked me to tell you about my collection. A month ago I had to give a talk to an art club, so I talked about my dolls and figurines. The only new dolls I have are these three lovely new Irish dolls. One of these three dolls is an old Fishermen with a Net over his back. Another is an old woman with wood on her back and the third is a little boy.\u201d The letter had been addressed to Se\u00f1ora In\u00e9z Lopez Molinari in Buenos Aires. No such person existed; the letter was returned to the address listed on the envelope, the address of one of Dickinson\u2019s customers, a Mrs. Mary E. Wallace in Springfield, Ohio, who was confused to read the letter, as she had not written it.\nDickinson owned a doll shop on Madison Avenue in New York and had developed a reputation for her artistry\u2014she sold dolls for as much as $750 apiece\u2014yet the bureau discovered that she had fallen into debt after the death of her husband, that she was a member of the Japanese-American Society, and she had visited the West Coast in January 1942, immediately after Pearl Harbor. The FBI tested the shapes of ink on the letters against Dickinson\u2019s seized typewriter and confirmed a match; the bureau\u2019s investigation also revealed social ties between Dickinson and Japanese consular officials.\nAfter the agents arrested Dickinson in January 1944, a federal prosecutor took up the case: Edward C. Wallace, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. Wallace had worked with Elizebeth Smith Friedman in the smuggling days and hoped to get her opinion on the Doll Lady\u2019s letters, but first he called the supervisor of the FBI\u2019s New York office and asked if the bureau had any objection to showing Elizebeth the letters.\nWithin the FBI, the prosecutor\u2019s request provoked a remarkable exchange of at least eight phone calls, teletype messages, and memos that traveled up the chain from the FBI\u2019s New York office to Washington and ultimately to the desk of J. Edgar Hoover. The gist of these communications was that the prosecutor, Edward Wallace, wanted Elizebeth and spoke highly of her\u2014\u201cAccording to Mr. Wallace,\u201d an FBI agent in Washington wrote in a memo to Hoover\u2019s deputy, \u201cMrs. Friedman and her husband, who is a cryptographer for the Army, are recognized as the leading authorities in the country and have written numerous books on the subject\u201d\u2014but FBI agents worried that Elizebeth would siphon publicity from the bureau, stealing its spotlight. The agents seemed reluctant to speak of Elizebeth as an independent analyst separate from her husband. Although no one had ever discussed involving William in the case, the supervisor of the FBI\u2019s New York office fretted that the Friedmans, plural, \u201cmight, in the event of a successful espionage prosecution, attempt to lay claim for any work that they might have performed in this connection.\u201d\nThe New York office sent Hoover a teletype on March 18, 1944: \u201cadvise as to submission questioned letters to Elizabeth Friedman for examination.\u201d Hoover responded with a dismissive shrug of a memo: \u201cConcerning the project to submit the documents to Mrs. Friedman...There appears no point is to be gained by multiplying the number of examiners.\u201d But he posed no formal objection, so U.S. Attorney Wallace went ahead and sent Elizebeth the Doll Lady\u2019s letters, and Elizebeth analyzed them and crystallized her thoughts into a five-page letter before traveling to New York at the feds\u2019 expense to discuss the case with Wallace in person.\n\u201cMy dear Mr. Wallace,\u201d Elizebeth began in her letter, \u201cWithin the last two days I have spent a few hours examining the Dickinson letters. I am setting forth here some queries and statements which may be accepted for what they are worth, mindful of your statement on the telephone that you hope to obtain \u2018leads,\u2019 and that you understand that the code in the letters is the \u2018intangible\u2019 type of method not susceptible to scientific proof.\u201d\nAfter making it clear that this was not the usual sort of cryptanalysis that she did, that this was only her opinion, Elizebeth went on to discuss what the Doll Lady was really talking about when she talked about dolls.\nThe letters, she said, were a textbook example of \u201copen code,\u201d a way of communicating secretly out in the open, without necessarily arousing suspicion. \u201cGranddaughter\u2019s doll\u201d in one letter might refer to a U.S. ship that had been damaged at Pearl Harbor and was being repaired. \u201cFamily\u201d meant the Japanese fleet. \u201cEnglish dolls\u201d meant three classes of English ships, such as a battleship, battlecruiser, or destroyer. Where Dickinson wrote, \u201cOne of these three dolls is an old Fishermen with a Net over his back\u201d and \u201canother is an old woman with wood on her back and the third is a little boy,\u201d she probably meant, \u201cOne of these three war- ships is a minesweeper, and another is a warship with superstructure, and the third is a small warship.\u201d (\u201cDestroyer?\u201d Elizebeth guessed. \u201cTorpedo boat? Auxiliary warship?\u201d)\nElizebeth also pointed out that the street number of the address in the five letters\u2014Se\u00f1ora In\u00e9z, O\u2019Higgins Street, Buenos Aires\u2014was given as five different numbers (1414 O\u2019Higgins, 2563 O\u2019Higgins, etc.), suggesting that the messages were never meant to reach their destination and were intended to be intercepted en route, in an airline pouch or a censorship office, by a friendly Axis confederate.\nElizebeth\u2019s letter shows her analytical brilliance; it also shows her native cautiousness, her reluctance to say anything that couldn\u2019t absolutely be proven. Words in an open code can have multiple meanings. She didn\u2019t want to testify in court for this reason. Hoover saw it differently. To him, the vagueness of an open code was an advantage, not a disadvantage, enabling his agents \u201cto give the more extended estimates and alternative possibilities\u201d during cross-examination.\nThe FBI had gathered other damning evidence against Dickinson, including the unexplained cash and her relations with Japanese officials, and the government charged Dickinson with espionage, as a spy for the imperial Japanese government. The charge carried the death penalty. As far as anyone knew, Dickinson was the first woman to be accused of espionage on American soil since World War II\u2019s start. \u201cSo far,\u201d wrote the Washington Sunday Star, \u201con this side of the water, Mrs. Dickinson is the woman spy of this war.\u201d During her first court appearance in New York in May 1944, Dickinson looked subdued, wore a black hat pinned with imitation white flowers, and twisted a handkerchief behind her back with black-gloved hands, glancing around the courtroom at the FBI agents and prosecutors and reporters: \u201cWho are all these people?\u201d she said. When the prosecutor spoke, \u201cShe even yawned, decorously behind a hand,\u201d the Washington Times- Herald reported.\nDickinson pleaded guilty. At her sentencing three months later she denied that she was a spy, breaking down in court and swearing that she didn\u2019t know a \u201cbattleship from any other ship except that it\u2019s larger.\u201d She ended up with ten years in prison and a $10,000 fine.\nAll through these proceedings, Elizebeth stayed out of the public eye. When the Doll Lady case was over, the conviction won, the FBI, as always, informed the press of its heroism, feeding the dramatic details of \u201cthe War\u2019s No. 1 Woman Spy\u201d to reporters. \u201cWhat made her become a Japanese spy?\u201d asked the Star. \u201cOne FBI man who questioned her advanced the idea that she was an introvert, embittered by life, the frustration of childlessness.\u201d Elizebeth was not mentioned in the coverage. The articles said variously that the code had been cracked by \u201cFBI cryptographers\u201d or \u201ca check with the Navy.\u201d Hoover himself wrote about the Doll Lady in The American Magazine, calling her \u201cone of the cleverest woman operators I have encountered.

He flips to CNN for news, moves to \u201cFox & Friends\u201d for comfort and messaging ideas, and sometimes watches MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d because, friends suspect, it fires him up for the day.\nEnergized, infuriated \u2014 often a gumbo of both \u2014 Mr. Trump grabs his iPhone. Sometimes he tweets while propped on his pillow, according to aides. Other times he tweets from the den next door, watching another television. Less frequently, he makes his way up the hall to the ornate Treaty Room, sometimes dressed for the day, sometimes still in night clothes, where he begins his official and unofficial calls.\nAs he ends his first year in office, Mr. Trump is redefining what it means to be president. He sees the highest office in the land much as he did the night of his stunning victory over Hillary Clinton \u2014 as a prize he must fight to protect every waking moment, and Twitter is his Excalibur. Despite all his bluster, he views himself less as a titan dominating the world stage than a maligned outsider engaged in a struggle to be taken seriously, according to interviews with 60 advisers, associates, friends and members of Congress.\nFor other presidents, every day is a test of how to lead a country, not just a faction, balancing competing interests. For Mr. Trump, every day is an hour-by-hour battle for self-preservation. He still relitigates last year\u2019s election, convinced that the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, into Russia \u2019s interference is a plot to delegitimize him. Color-coded maps highlighting the counties he won were hung on the White House walls.\nBefore taking office, Mr. Trump told top aides to think of each presidential day as an episode in a television show in which he vanquishes rivals. People close to him estimate that Mr. Trump spends at least four hours a day, and sometimes as much as twice that, in front of a television, sometimes with the volume muted, marinating in the no-holds-barred wars of cable news and eager to fire back.\n\u201cHe feels like there\u2019s an effort to undermine his election and that collusion allegations are unfounded,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who has spent more time with the president than most lawmakers. \u201cHe believes passionately that the liberal left and the media are out to destroy him. The way he got here is fighting back and counterpunching.\n\u201cThe problem he\u2019s going to face,\u201d Mr. Graham added, \u201cis there\u2019s a difference between running for the office and being president. You\u2019ve got to find that sweet spot between being a fighter and being president.\u201d\nBracing and refreshing to his alienated-from-the-system political base, Mr. Trump\u2019s uninhibited approach seems erratic to many veterans of both parties in the capital and beyond. Some politicians and pundits lament the instability and, even without medical degrees, feel no compunction about publicly diagnosing various mental maladies.\nIn recent weeks, the president made a derogatory reference to Native Americans in front of Navajo guests, insinuated that a television host was involved in the death of an aide and prompted an international incident with Britain by retweeting inflammatory anti-Muslim videos \u2014 demonstrating the limits of a staff that has tried hard to steer him away from volatile territory.\nHis approach got him to the White House, Mr. Trump reasons, so it must be the right one. He is more unpopular than any of his modern predecessors at this point in his tenure \u2014 just 32 percent approved of his performance in the latest Pew Research Center poll \u2014 yet he dominates the landscape like no other.\nAfter months of legislative failures, Mr. Trump is on the verge of finally prevailing in his efforts to cut taxes and reverse part of his predecessor\u2019s health care program. While much of what he has promised remains undone, he has made significant progress in his goal of rolling back business and environmental regulations. The growing economy he inherited continues to improve, and stock markets have soared to record heights. His partial travel ban on mainly Muslim countries has finally taken effect after multiple court fights.\nJared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser, has told associates that Mr. Trump, deeply set in his ways at age 71, will never change. Rather, he predicted, Mr. Trump would bend, and possibly break, the office to his will.\nThat has proved half true. Mr. Trump, so far, has arguably wrestled the presidency to a draw.\nImage\nDay breaks on the South Portico of the White House.CreditTom Brenner/The New York Times\n\u2018Time to Think\u2019\nIn the jargon of the military, John F. Kelly, a retired four-star general, served as a \u201cwagon boss\u201d for Marines crashing into Iraq in 2003, keeping his column moving forward despite incoming fire. As White House chief of staff , Mr. Kelly has adopted much the same approach, laboring 14-hour days to impose discipline on a chaotic operation \u2014 with mixed success.\nIn the months before Mr. Kelly took over last summer from his embattled predecessor, Reince Priebus, the Oval Office had a rush-hour feel, with a constant stream of aides and visitors stopping by to offer advice or kibitz. During one April meeting with New York Times reporters, no fewer than 20 people wandered in and out \u2014 including Mr. Priebus, who walked in with Vice President Mike Pence. The door to the Oval Office is now mostly closed.\nMr. Kelly is trying, quietly and respectfully, to reduce the amount of free time the president has for fiery tweets by accelerating the start of his workday. Mr. Priebus also tried, with only modest success, to encourage Mr. Trump to arrive by 9 or 9:30 a.m.\nThe pace of meetings has increased. Beyond Mr. Kelly and Mr. Kushner, they often include Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser; Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and senior adviser; Hope Hicks, the communications director; Robert Porter, the staff secretary; and Kellyanne Conway, the president\u2019s counselor.\nMr. Trump, who enjoyed complete control over his business empire, has made significant concessions after trying to micromanage his first months in office. Despite chafing at the limits, the president actually craves the approval of Mr. Kelly, whom he sees as a peer, people close to Mr. Trump said.\nHe calls Mr. Kelly up to a dozen times a day, even four or five times during dinner or a golf outing, to ask about his schedule or seek policy advice, according to people who have spoken with the president. The new system gives him \u201ctime to think,\u201d he said when it began. White House aides denied that Mr. Trump seeks Mr. Kelly\u2019s blessing, but confirmed that he views him as a crucial confidant and sounding board. Mr. Kelly has also adopted some of Mr. Trump\u2019s favorite grievances, telling the president recently that he agrees that some reporters are interested only in taking down the administration.\nAt times, Mr. Trump has been able to circumvent Mr. Kelly. Over Thanksgiving at Mar-a-Lago, the president mingled with guests the way he had before the election. Some passed him news clips that would never get around Mr. Kelly\u2019s filters. And he dialed old friends, receiving updates about how they see the Russia investigation. He returned to Washington fired up.\nMr. Kelly has told people he will try to control only what he can. As he has learned, there is much that he cannot.\nImage\nJohn F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, has labored 14-hour days to impose discipline on a chaotic operation, with mixed success.CreditTom Brenner/The New York Times\n\u2018I Don\u2019t Watch Much\u2019\nFor most of the year, people inside and outside Washington have been convinced that there is a strategy behind Mr. Trump\u2019s actions. But there is seldom a plan apart from pre-emption, self-defense, obsession and impulse.\nOccasionally, the president solicits affirmation before hitting the \u201ctweet\u201d button. In June, according to a longtime adviser, he excitedly called friends to say he had the perfect tweet to neutralize the Russia investigation. He would call it a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d They were unimpressed.\nHe has bowed to advice from his lawyers by not attacking Mr. Mueller, but at times his instincts prevail.\nWhen three former campaign advisers were indicted or pleaded guilty this fall, Ty Cobb, the White House lawyer handling the investigation, urged the president not to respond. If he did, it would only elevate the story.\nMr. Trump, however, could not help himself. He tweeted that the financial charges lodged against his former campaign manager, Paul J. Manafort, had nothing to do with the campaign and that investigators should be examining \u201cCrooked Hillary & the Dems\u201d instead. By the next morning, he was belittling George Papadopoulos, the campaign adviser who pleaded guilty to lying about his outreach to Russians, dismissing him as a \u201clow level volunteer\u201d who has \u201cproven to be a liar.\u201d\nHe was calm at first when his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, pleaded guilty. The next morning, as he visited Manhattan for Republican fund-raisers, he was upbeat. He talked about his election and the \u201cmajor loser\u201d in the Senate who had said his tax bill would add to the deficit (presumably meaning Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee).\nBy Sunday morning, with news shows consumed by Mr. Flynn\u2019s case, the president grew angry and fired off a series of tweets excoriating Mrs. Clinton and the F.B.I., tweets that several advisers told him were problematic and needed to stop, according to a person briefed on the discussion.\nOnce he posts controversial messages, Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers sometimes decide not to raise them with him. One adviser said that aides to the president needed to stay positive and look for silver linings wherever they could find them, and that the West Wing team at times resolved not to let the tweets dominate their day.\nThe ammunition for his Twitter war is television. No one touches the remote control except Mr. Trump and the technical support staff \u2014 at least that\u2019s the rule. During meetings, the 60-inch screen mounted in the dining room may be muted, but Mr. Trump keeps an eye on scrolling headlines. What he misses he checks out later on what he calls his \u201cSuper TiVo,\u201d a state-of-the-art system that records cable news.\nWatching cable, he shares thoughts with anyone in the room, even the household staff he summons via a button for lunch or for one of the dozen Diet Cokes he consumes each day.\nBut he is leery of being seen as tube-glued \u2014 a perception that reinforces the criticism that he is not taking the job seriously. On his recent trip to Asia, the president was told of a list of 51 fact-checking questions for this article, including one about his prodigious television watching habits. Instead of responding through an aide, he delivered a broadside on his viewing habits to befuddled reporters from other outlets on Air Force One heading to Vietnam .\n\u201cI do not watch much television,\u201d he insisted. \u201cI know they like to say \u2014 people that don\u2019t know me \u2014 they like to say I watch television. People with fake sources \u2014 you know, fake reporters, fake sources. But I don\u2019t get to watch much television, primarily because of documents. I\u2019m reading documents a lot.\u201d\nLater, he groused about being forced to watch CNN in the Philippines because nothing else was available.\nImage\nBefore taking office, Mr. Trump told top aides to think of each presidential day as an episode in a television show in which he vanquishes his rivals. Here, he called journalists back into the Roosevelt Room in January to hear a union leader praise him.CreditDoug Mills/The New York Times\n\u2018Aren\u2019t You Glad I Don\u2019t Drink?\u2019\nTo an extent that would stun outsiders, Mr. Trump, the most talked-about human on the planet, is still delighted when he sees his name in the headlines. And he is on a perpetual quest to see it there. One former top adviser said Mr. Trump grew uncomfortable after two or three days of peace and could not handle watching the news without seeing himself on it.\nDuring the morning, aides monitor \u201cFox & Friends\u201d live or through a transcription service in much the way commodities traders might keep tabs on market futures to predict the direction of their day.\nIf someone on the show says something memorable and Mr. Trump does not immediately tweet about it, the president\u2019s staff knows he may be saving Fox News for later viewing on his recorder and instead watching MSNBC or CNN live \u2014 meaning he is likely to be in a foul mood to start the day.\nYet the image of him in a constant rage belies a deeper complexity for a man who runs in bellow-and-banter cycles. Several advisers said the president may curse them for a minor transgression \u2014 like bringing an unknown aide into his presence without warning \u2014 then make amiable small talk with the same person minutes later.\n\u201cHe is very aware that he is only the 45th person to hold that job,\u201d Ms. Conway said. \u201cThe job has changed him a bit, and he has changed the job. His time as president has revealed other, more affable and accessible, parts and pieces of him that may have been hidden from view during a rough and tumble primary.\u201d\nFew get to see those other parts and pieces. In private moments with the families of appointees in the Oval Office, the president engages with children in a softer tone than he takes in public, and he specifically asked that the children of the White House press corps be invited in as they visited on Halloween. Yet he does little to promote that side, some longtime friends say, because it cracks the veneer of strength that he relishes.\nOnly occasionally does Mr. Trump let slip his mask of unreflective invincibility. During a meeting with Republican senators, he discussed in emotional terms the opioid crisis and the dangers of addiction, recounting his brother\u2019s struggle with alcohol.\nAccording to a senator and an aide, the president then looked around the room and asked puckishly, \u201cAren\u2019t you glad I don\u2019t drink?\u201d\nImage\nMr. Trump\u2019s uninhibited approach seems erratic to veterans of both parties in the capital.CreditTom Brenner/The New York Times\n\u2018Don\u2019t Interrupt Me\u2019\nMr. Trump\u2019s difficult adjustment to the presidency, people close to him say, is rooted in an unrealistic expectation of its powers, which he had assumed to be more akin to the popular image of imperial command than the sloppy reality of having to coexist with two other branches of government.\nHis vision of executive leadership was shaped close to home, by experiences with Democratic clubhouse politicians as a young developer in New York. One figure stands out to Mr. Trump: an unnamed party boss \u2014 his friends assume he is referring to the legendary Brooklyn fixer Meade Esposito \u2014 whom he remembered keeping a baseball bat under his desk to enforce his power. To the adviser who recounted it, the story revealed what Mr. Trump expected being president would be like \u2014 ruling by fiat, exacting tribute and cutting back room deals.\nBut while he is unlikely to change who he is on a fundamental level, advisers said they saw a novice who was gradually learning that the presidency does not work that way. And he is coming to realize, they said, the need to woo, not whack, leaders of his own party to get things done.\nDuring his early months in office, he barked commands at senators, which did not go over well. \u201cI don\u2019t work for you, Mr. President,\u201d Mr. Corker once snapped back, according to a Republican with knowledge of the exchange.\nSenator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader, likewise bristled when Mr. Trump cut in during methodical presentations in the Oval Office. \u201cDon\u2019t interrupt me,\u201d Mr. McConnell told the president during a discussion of health care.\nMr. Trump may have gotten the message. After a bout of public feuding last summer, he and Mr. McConnell reconciled and began speaking most days. And as the president increasingly recognizes how much Congress controls his fate, Marc Short, the legislative affairs director, has sought to educate him by appealing to Mr. Trump\u2019s tendency to view issues in terms of personality, compiling one-page profiles of legislators for him, the congressional equivalent of baseball cards.\nWhile he is no policy wonk \u2014 \u201cnobody knew that health care could be so complicated ,\u201d he famously said at one point \u2014 he has shown more comfort with the details of his tax-cutting legislation. And aides said he had become more attentive during daily intelligence briefings thanks to pithy presentations by Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director, and a deeper concern about the North Korea situation than his blithe, confrontational tweets suggest.\n\u201cAt first, there was a thread of being an impostor that may have been in his mind,\u201d said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, who has tried to forge a working relationship with the president.\n\u201cHe\u2019s overcome that by now,\u201d she said. \u201cThe bigger problem, the thing people need to understand, is that he was utterly unprepared for this. It would be like you or me going into a room and being asked to perform brain surgery. When you have a lack of knowledge as great as his, it can be bewildering.\u201d\nMr. Graham, once a fierce critic and now increasingly an ally, said Mr. Trump was adjusting. \u201cYou can expect every president to change because the job requires you to change,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s learning the rhythm of the town.\u201d But Mr. Graham added that Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency was still \u201ca work in progress.\u201d At this point, he said, \u201ceverything\u2019s possible, from complete disaster to a home run.\u201d\nImage\nMr. Trump has said that the Oval Office feels empty now that Keith Schiller, his longtime aide, is gone.CreditAl Drago for The New York Times\n\u2018He Wears You Down\u2019\nIn almost all the interviews, Mr. Trump\u2019s associates raised questions about his capacity and willingness to differentiate bad information from something that is true.\nMonitoring his information consumption \u2014 and countering what Mr. Kelly calls \u201cgarbage\u201d peddled to him by outsiders \u2014 remains a priority for the chief of staff and the team he has made his own. Even after a year of official briefings and access to the best minds of the federal government, Mr. Trump is skeptical of anything that does not come from inside his bubble.\nSome advisers, like the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, consider this a fundamentally good thing. \u201cI see a lot of similarities between the way he was running the campaign and the way he is as president,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cHe really loves verbal briefings. He is not one to consume volumes of books or briefings.\u201d\nOther aides bemoan his tenuous grasp of facts, jack-rabbit attention span and propensity for conspiracy theories.\nMr. Kelly has told people he pushed out advisers like Stephen K. Bannon and Sebastian Gorka , who he believed advanced information to rile up Mr. Trump or create internal conflict. But Mr. Trump still controls his own guest list.\nJeanine Pirro, whose Fox News show is a presidential favorite, recently asked to meet about a deal approved while Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state that gave Russia control over some American uranium, which lately has become a favorite focus of conservatives.\nMr. Trump, Mr. Kelly and Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, met for more than an hour on Nov. 1 as Ms. Pirro whipped up the president against Mr. Mueller and accused James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, of employing tactics typically reserved for Mafia cases, according to a person briefed on the meeting.\nThe president became visibly agitated as she spoke. \u201cRoy Cohn was my lawyer!\u201d he exclaimed, referring to the legendary McCarthy-era fixer who mentored Mr. Trump in the 1980s, suggesting that was the type of defender he needed now.\nAt another point, Mr. Kelly interrupted. She was not \u201chelping things,\u201d he said, according to the person briefed. Even Mr. Trump eventually tired of Ms. Pirro\u2019s screed and walked out of the room, according to the person.\nMr. Trump is an avid newspaper reader who still marks up a half-dozen papers with comments in black Sharpie pen, but Mr. Bannon has told allies that Mr. Trump only \u201creads to reinforce.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s insistence on defining his own reality \u2014 his repeated claims, for example, that he actually won the popular vote \u2014 is immutable and has had a \u201cnumbing effect\u201d on people who work with him, said Tony Schwartz, his ghostwriter on \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d\n\u201cHe wears you down,\u201d Mr. Schwartz said.\nImage\nMr. Trump spends at least four hours a day, and sometimes as much as twice that, in front of a television, sometimes with the volume muted, marinating in the no-holds-barred wars of cable news and eager to fire back.CreditTom Brenner/The New York Times\n\u2018Where the Hell Have You Been?\u2019\nSome of the changes resulting from Mr. Kelly\u2019s arrival have been subtle. For the last decade, for example, Mr. Trump\u2019s most trusted aide was his longtime security chief, Keith Schiller , a bald, brawny former New York police officer who played an ambiguous role as protector, gatekeeper and younger brother to the president. An early warning system, Mr. Schiller tipped callers when the boss was in a bad mood and sometimes reached out to the president\u2019s friends to urge them to buck him up.\nIn August, Mr. Trump asked Mr. Schiller for a newspaper article he had heard about. After Mr. Trump mentioned the article to Mr. Kelly, the chief of staff dispatched two aides to investigate how it had gotten to the president without being cleared. Mr. Schiller acknowledged providing the contraband newsprint. Mr. Kelly thanked him tersely for coming forward, according to two people Mr. Schiller later told.\nTo the surprise of aides, the president did not try to make clear Mr. Schiller\u2019s unique place in the Trump orbit. After some additional encounters with Mr. Kelly, Mr. Schiller announced his departure , a decision fueled primarily by a dislike for Washington and a desire to once again earn private-sector pay before retiring.\nSince then, Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed frustration at Mr. Schiller\u2019s absence, telling a visiting lawmaker that his Oval Office suite now seems \u201cempty.\u201d The departure of other familiar faces has been equally unsettling.\nOnce this fall, Mr. Trump lashed out at an aide he had not seen for weeks, asking, \u201cWhere the hell have you been?\u201d When the aide told him that Mr. Kelly had limited the meetings he could attend, the president cooled off and said, \u201cOh, O.K.,\u201d according to an aide told of the exchange.\nIf Mr. Kelly knows he cannot always control access, he is intent on at least knowing who is peddling what to his boss. He reserves the right to listen to calls coming to the president through the White House switchboard. To some callers, Mr. Kelly politely promises to forward messages. On calls he cannot monitor personally, Mr. Kelly or a deputy will usually double-back to debrief the caller on any promises the president may have made in unguarded moments.\nImage\nOn weekdays, Mr. Trump\u2019s principal mode of blowing off steam is his nightly dinner in the residence. He has always relished gossiping over plates of well-done steak, salad slathered with Roquefort dressing and bacon crumbles, tureens of gravy and huge slices of dessert with extra ice cream.CreditTom Brenner/The New York Times\n\u2018I Can Invite Anyone\u2019\nMr. Trump seeks release on the golf course on weekends. But on weekdays, his principal mode of blowing off steam is his nightly dinner in the White House residence, which begins at 6:30 or 7 p.m. with a guest list organized by the ever-vigilant Mr. Kelly.\n\u201cI can invite anyone for dinner, and they will come!\u201d Mr. Trump marveled to an old friend when he took office.\nMr. Trump has always relished gossiping over plates of well-done steak, salad slathered with Roquefort dressing and bacon crumbles, tureens of gravy and massive slices of dessert with extra ice cream.\nHe needs support, a sounding board and, as a lifelong hotelier, guests. Mr. Trump is naturally garrulous, and loves to give White House tours. He has an odd affinity for showing off bathrooms, including one he renovated near the Oval Office, and enjoys pulling dinner companions into the Lincoln Bedroom or onto the Truman Balcony for the postcard view of the city he has disrupted.\nOver the summer, he invited four Democratic lawmakers and immediately peppered them with questions as they strolled through the Diplomatic Reception Room.\n\u201cWho is going to run against me in 2020?\u201d he asked, according to a person in attendance. \u201cCrooked Hillary? Pocahontas?\u201d \u2014 his caustic nickname for Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, who once claimed Native American heritage in a law school directory.\nSenator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the president opined, would definitely run \u2014 \u201ceven if he\u2019s in a wheelchair,\u201d Mr. Trump added, making a scrunched-up body of a man in a wheelchair.\nMr. Trump still takes shots at Mark Cuban, a fellow rich-guy reality star, and expresses disappointment that Tom Brady, the New England Patriots quarterback, has distanced himself. But he spends much of his time now puzzling over political options and wrestling with the terrifying responsibilities of the presidency.\nEven when Mr. Trump is in a lighthearted mood, hints of anxiety waft over the table like steam over a teacup. In September, he met with evangelical leaders to reassure them that he would still pursue their agenda despite a flirtation with Democrats.\n\u201cThe Christians know all the things I\u2019m doing for them, right?\u201d he asked, according to three attendees, who reported praising his positions on issues like abortion and Planned Parenthood.\nWhen the guests depart, the remote control comes back out. He is less likely to tweet at this hour, when the news he would react to is mostly recycled from hours earlier. But he watches Ms. Pirro and her fellow Fox News hosts Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham, and sometimes \u201chate-watches\u201d CNN to get worked up, especially Don Lemon.\nIn between, it is time for phone calls, to people he has fired like Corey Lewandowski and Mr. Bannon, old friends like Thomas J. Barrack Jr. and Richard LeFrak, and more recently Republican lawmakers, especially Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, the head of the conservative Freedom Caucus. This is when his fixations are unfettered: Russia, Mrs. Clinton, Barack Obama , the \u201cfake news\u201d media, his bitter disappointment with Attorney General Jeff Sessions .\nIn recent weeks, Mr. Trump\u2019s friends have noticed a different pitch, acknowledging that many aides and even his own relatives could be hurt by Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation. As for himself, he has adopted a surprisingly fatalistic attitude, according to several people he speaks with regularly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s life,\u201d he said of the investigation.\nFrom there it is off to bed for what usually amounts to five or six hours of sleep. Then the television will be blaring again, he will reach for his iPhone and the battle will begin anew.\nImage\nIn recent weeks, Mr. Trump\u2019s friends said, he has expressed fear about how many aides, even his own relatives, could be hurt by the investigation into Russian election meddling.CreditDoug Mills/The New York Times\nGlenn Thrush contributed to this article before he was suspended pending the result of an investigation into allegations of inappropriate behavior.

        "text": "Fight Back News Service is circulating the following Oct. 31 article from Tribuna Popular, the newspaper of the Communist Party of Venezuela (PCV). The article was translated by Fight Back! staff.\nThe Political Bureau of the Communist Party of Venezuela (PCV) revealed that they are holding, with other allied political organizations and social movements, a national day of people's mobilization against the starvation of the people and in defense of workers\u2019 rights, to demand that the national government and the National Constituent Assembly (ANC) confront the economic crisis.\n\u201cIn order to confront the aggressive and criminal speculative escalation of the costs of basic goods, the PCV has proposed, to the organizations of the Anti-Imperialist and Anti-Fascist Popular Front and other parties of the patriotic camp, the organization of this day of struggle,\u201d said Oscar Figuera, general secretary of the communist camp.\nThe mobilization will have as its destination the national office of Fedec\u00e1maras [the Venezuelan Chamber of Commerce] in Caracas, the Presidency of the Republic and the ANC.\n\u201cThe objective is to denounce the criminal policies of Fedec\u00e1maras and other affiliated businessmen, those monopoly capitalists and lapdogs of imperialism, and also to demand that the government take energetic action to prevent this process of aggression from continuing its course,\u201d stated Figuera.\nNoone can disrespect the people for their criticisms and demands\nThe PCV stated their position in defense of the people's movement that has criticized the passivity of the government and the ANC in recent weeks, in the face of a concerning rise of prices, and has been threatened that they will be remembered as traitors or fools.\n\u201cWe do not coincide with those, acting in their authority as Constituents, who go off condemning the demands of the people's movement to the ANC and the national government; there are speakers in the ANC that go to the extreme disrespecting the people, accusing them of being traitor, counter-revolutionaries and fools,\u201d said Figuera.\nIn equal manner the Party alerted that if the working people do not perceive concrete action from the national government, then the electoral victories achieved by the patriotic forces will begin to dilute.\n\u201cThe people elected the government and the ANC so that they will take concrete actions, if they do not comply with what they promised then they will be moved aside,\u201d emphasized the PCV.\nActs of the Centenary of the Bolshevik Revolution\nThe VI Plenum of the PCV, held on Oct. 29, approved the commemoration plan of the Centenary of the Bolshevik Revolution, as a significant date for the international revolutionary movement, which was a milestone in the history of workers\u2019 and people\u2019s struggles against capitalism and reactionary and reformist forces.\n\u201cThe beginning of the commemoration will be on Nov. 7 with a political cultural event in the Bol\u00edvar Plaza in Caracas, and we will continue with various days of workshops and meetings in the Cantaclaro Theater, the national headquarters of the PCV,\u201d said Oscar Figuera.\nHe added that the activities will conclude on Nov. 18 with an event at the headquarters of the PCV.",

        "text": "What's The Meaning Of The World Bank's New Poverty Lines?\nAccording to the World Bank, if you're living on $1.90 a day or less, you're living in extreme poverty.\nThe 767 million people in that category have $1.90 a day or less in purchasing power to fulfill their daily needs.\nMost of that money goes for food \u2013 only it may not be enough to purchase nutritious food or to stave off hunger. Hundreds of millions of the extreme poor are malnourished.\nTheir housing may be of low quality. And they may not have enough money for school fees (primary education isn't always free) or health-care expenses.\nMillions of the extremely poor live in the world's low-income countries. But here's a surprising fact: Well over half of the extremely poor live in middle income countries like India, Nigeria and China.\nAnd here's another point to consider: You can have more than $1.90 a day to spend on the basic necessities and still live in relative poverty.\nAs the World Bank puts it in a poverty FAQ: \"Not surprisingly, richer countries tend to have higher poverty lines, while poorer countries have lower poverty lines.\"\nThat's why the World Bank has come up with two new \"poverty line\" figures for the world's middle-income countries: $3.20 a day for lower middle income nations (like Egypt, India and the Philippines) and $5.50 a day for upper middle income nations (like Brazil, Jamaica and South Africa).\nLoading...\nThe idea is that the new numbers offer a better way to measure poverty in middle-income countries.\n\"These new numbers are closer to the individual country's national poverty lines,\" says Homi Kharas, senior fellow and co-director of the Global Economy and Development Program at the Brookings Institution.\nThey represent a \"fixed benchmark to judge whether poverty is going up or going down in the world\" \u2013 and for middle-income countries to see how they're doing.\nOf course, it's natural to be a bit befuddled about the meaning of these new figures.\n\"The challenge the World Bank has is to make sure people don't get confused,\" says Kharas.\nIn a nutshell, there's extreme poverty ... and just plain poverty.\n\"If you're living in shantytown slums around Lima with no basic services and scraping to get basic subsistence, you would say, 'Yeah, I'm poor,' \u2014 even though the World Bank might measure your income at $4 a day,\" says Justin Sandefur, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development.\nHe also notes that \"there almost isn't anyone in middle-income countries as poor as the most people in Ethiopia.\"\nAs for efforts to help the world's extreme poor \u2014 there's good news on that front.\nBetween 1990 and 2013, the number of people living on $1.90 a day or less has been cut roughly in half. The United Nations has committed to ending extreme poverty as one of its Sustainable Development Goals, an ambitious set of 17 targets for the world to reach by 2030.\nBut that doesn't mean poverty will vanish. The new poverty line numbers serve as a reminder, says Sandefur, that even though extreme poverty is declining, \"we still have deep, intractable pockets of poverty in many countries.\"",

        "text": "Marie Sklodowska Curie, born Maria Salomea Sklodowska on 7 November 1867 in Warsaw, Kingdom of Poland , was a Polish and naturalized-French physicist and chemist who carried out pioneering research on radioactivity, a term that she coined.\nCurie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize. She became the first person to win the Nobel Prize twice. She is still the only person to win Nobel Prize in two different sciences: in physics in 1903 and in chemistry in 1911.\nCurie\u2019s accomplishments included the development of the theory of radioactivity, techniques for isolating radioactive isotopes, and the discovery of two chemical elements, polonium and radium. Under her direction, the world\u2019s first studies were conducted into the treatment of neoplasms, using radioactive isotopes.\nMarie Curie founded the Curie Institutes in Paris and in Warsaw, which remain major centers of medical research today. During the First World War, she developed mobile radiography units to provide X-ray services to field hospitals.\nWhile a French citizen, Curie always maintained her Polish identity. She taught her two daughters the Polish language and took them on visits to Poland. She named the first chemical element that she discovered\u2014polonium, which she isolated in 1898\u2014after her native country.\nMarie Curie died on 4 July 1934 at 66 at the Sancellemoz sanatorium in Passy, Haute-Savoie, France, of aplastic anemia from exposure to radiation in the courses of her scientific research and her radiological work at field hospitals during the First World War.\nThis month, on 7 November 2017, we will mark Curie\u2019s 150th birthday and in her honor, I prepared the following birthday brainteasers and arithmetic curiosities (many of the outcomes below only work using the European day-month format for dates, so I've used that style throughout):\nMarie Curie\u2019s 150th birthday is coded by her name: if numbers 1 to 26 are assigned to the letters of the French alphabet as A being one, B being two, C being three, etc., the sum of the numbers assigned to the letters of Marie Curie equals 102. Coincidentally, 150 plus its reverse, namely 051, yields 201, which is the reverse of 102. Furthermore, 2017 is the 306th prime number where 306 is three times 102 (Marie Curie). Moreover, 201 equals 3 times 67 where 3 and 67 differ by 64 and the reverse of 64, namely 46, equals the sum of the numbers assigned to the letters of Marie. Additionally, Curie\u2019s 150th birthday coincides with the 311th day of 2017 where 311 is the 64th prime number. Curie\u2019s birth date, 7 November, expressed as 711 is also coded in her name: three times half of 102 (Marie Curie) equals 153 and the reverse of 153, namely 351, equals three times 117 where 117 is the reverse of 711. Just like her 50th birthday 100 years ago, Curie\u2019s 150th birthday expressed as 7/11/17 is special because it is a palindrome date. However, 100 years from now, Curie\u2019s 250th birthday expressed as 7/11/2117 will even be more special because it is a full palindrome date. Curie\u2019s 151st birthday next year written as 7/11/18 will be special too since 18 is 7 plus 11. Moreover, 7, 11, and 18 add up to 36 where the 36th prime number coincides with 151. French physicist Pierre Curie and Marie Curie got married in 1895 which was a numerically special year for the following reason: the last three letters of both Marie and Curie end with the letters R, I, and E, which are amazingly the 18th, 9th, and 5th letters of the French alphabet where 18, 9, and 5 put side by side make 1895 ! Further, Marie turned 28 later that year where twice 28 equals 56, the sum of the numbers assigned to the letters of Curie. Curie\u2019s 146th birthday expressed as 7/11/13 was a sequential date because it consisted of three consecutive prime numbers, 7, 11, and 13. Curie\u2019s 153rd birthday expressed as 7/11/20 will be special too since 7 and 11 are the 4th and 5th prime numbers where 4 times 5 equals 20. Moreover, the reverse of 153, namely 351, equals three times 117, where 117 is the reverse of 7/11. Curie\u2019s 158th birthday written as 7/11/2025 will also be unique because 2025 equals 45 squared, where 45 is made of digits 4 and 5, where again the 4th and 5th prime numbers are 7 and 11. Curie was born on 7/11 and died on 4/7 where the day number of her birth and the month number of her death are the same. Additionally, 7 and 11 differ by 4 (the day number of her death) and 4 and 7 add to 11 (the month number of her birth). If Curie\u2019s birthday 7/11/1867 is split as 711, 18, and 67, the product of the sum of the digits of 18 and 67 yields 117 which again is the reverse of 711. Curie was born on 711 (7/11) and died on 407 (4/07) and these two numbers add up to 1118. Also, Curie\u2019s 150th birthday coincides with the 311th day of this year where 311 minus 150 results in 161 and the 161st prime number is 947. These two numbers, namely 1118 and 947, are interestingly coded in Curie\u2019s birthday: First, note that 1118 plus the reverse of 947, namely 749, gives 1867, the year Curie was born. Second, 947 times the reverse of 1118, namely 8111, results in 7681117, the reverse of which is 7111867. Lastly, one plus twice 947 yields 1895, the year that the Curies married.\nHappy 150th birthday to Marie Curie!",

        "text": "Why builders of big L.A. projects are making concrete with gravel and sand shipped from Canada Conveyor belts stretching more than a mile carry gravel and sand from the Orca quarry on Vancouver Island, Canada, to a ship off the coast of Port McNeil. Thanks to a combination of materials science, cheap ocean shipping and, some argue, NIMBYism, today\u2019s industrial concrete mixers in L.A. are often filled with imported rock and sand. (Polaris Materials)\nThe 519 miles of L.A.\u2019s freeway system. Dodger Stadium. City Hall. All built with concrete filled with rock and sand washed down from Southern California\u2019s iconic mountain ranges.\nFor evidence of that mineral abundance, look no further than Irwindale, home to more than a dozen massive pits emptied last century for those critical building components.\nBut now, as another building boom rumbles across Los Angeles and a new generation of high-rises climbs skyward, the rock and sand are coming from a much more distant source: Canada\u2019s Vancouver Island, more than 1,400 miles away.\nThat\u2019s a long distance to ship commodities that are still abundant locally, sell for less than $20 a ton \u2014 and often cost more to transport than to mine.\nYet thanks to a combination of materials science, cheap ocean shipping and, some argue, NIMBYism, today\u2019s industrial concrete mixers are often filled with imported rock and sand.\nAt Polaris Materials' Orca quarry, located on the northern coast of Vancouver Island, gravel and sand are scraped from the sides of the pit. Polaris Materials\nConsider a new apartment building going up at 12th Street and Grand Avenue in downtown L.A. On a gloomy Halloween morning, two dozen workers poured the concrete that will form the 28th of the building\u2019s 38 stories.\nBefore that wet concrete was leveled and smoothed, before it was pumped to the top of the building, before it was mixed together at a plant near Vernon, it started out as cement powder, water, sand and gravel.\nAnd those last two ingredients began their journey weeks earlier on the largely undeveloped north side of Vancouver Island, just off the southwest coast of British Columbia.\nThere, near the logging town of Port McNeil, Polaris Materials and the indigenous \u2018Namgis First Nation own the Orca Quarry, a site where long-melted glaciers some 10,000 years ago deposited layers of sand and gravel as thick as 300 feet.\nThe materials, known in the construction business as aggregate, are scraped from the sides of the quarry pit, washed, sorted into piles and loaded onto conveyor belts that stretch more than a mile to a terminal floating on the Broughton Strait.\nThen, the rock and sand are dumped into dry-bulk carriers \u2014 picture an oil tanker, but designed to carry solid cargo such as coal or grain. Each ship can carry about 75,000 tons of aggregate.\nFrom Port McNeil, it\u2019s a four-day, 1,450-mile voyage down the coast to the Port of Long Beach, where Vancouver, Canada-based Polaris leases 8 acres of waterside real estate.\nConveyor belts stretching from the ship to the terminal can offload 2,000 to 3,000 tons of material an hour, taking as long as 40 hours to empty a full ship. The terminal, little more than a parking lot for aggregate, has room for about 120,000 tons of material.\nIt\u2019s then time for the aggregate to make its way to the construction sites \u2014 and, for the first time, to be loaded into trucks and be transported by road.\nConveyors are used to unload the gravel and sand from the Canadian quarry at a Port of Long Beach terminal (Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times). Gravel from Polaris' Orca quarry is piled up and stored at the Port of Long Beach (Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times). Samples of concrete made from the shipped Canadian materials. The concrete is being used by Webcor Builders on some high-rises going up in downtown Los Angeles (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times). Clockise from top: Conveyors are used to unload the gravel and sand from the Canadian quarry at a Port of Long Beach terminal (Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times). Samples of concrete made from the shipped Canadian materials. The concrete is being used by Webcor Builders on some high-rises going up in downtown Los Angeles (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times). Gravel from Polaris' Orca quarry is piled up and stored at the Port of Long Beach (Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times).\nThe fact that Polaris can move its aggregate from a Canadian quarry all the way to Long Beach without being transported by road is one of the reasons it\u2019s feasible to export such heavy, cheap material over such a long distance.\nWarren Coalson, a consultant to California mine and quarry operators, estimates it costs $220 to haul a standard 25-ton truckload on a 25-mile trip in L.A. traffic. That works out to about 35 cents per ton per mile.\nIn a massive oceangoing vessel, it\u2019s dramatically cheaper: roughly half a cent per ton per mile, Polaris spokesman Nick Van Dyk said.\nThat leads to some striking math: To ship 1 ton of rock over 1,450 miles of ocean to Long Beach costs about $7.25. To truck it from Long Beach to downtown L.A., about 25 miles, adds an additional $8.75. And at $16 combined, that\u2019s less than the $22.75 it might cost to truck a ton of aggregate on the 65-mile trip from a quarry in Palmdale to downtown.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the equation \u2014 that\u2019s what makes it work,\u201d Van Dyk said. \u201cThe logistics are a big part of it.\u201d\nAnd getting bigger.\nL.A.\u2019s local sand and gravel supplies aren\u2019t as local as they used to be. With most of Irwindale\u2019s quarries now vacant pits, projects might get aggregate from as far away as Palmdale or Victorville. San Diego and the San Francisco Bay Area, too, are having to tap increasingly distant sources.\nA 2012 report from the California state geologist estimates that quarries in Los Angeles County and the Bay Area have permits to produce less than one-third of the aggregate that will be needed over the next 50 years. San Diego, which already imports aggregate from Mexico, is in even worse shape.\nIt\u2019s not that California doesn\u2019t have enough sand and gravel. But as development has sprawled, quarries or potential quarry sites that were once in sparsely populated areas are now surrounded by people \u2014 who don\u2019t want the attendant noise, pollution and truck traffic.\nThose concerns pushed Riverside County in 2012 to reject Granite Construction\u2019s proposal to open a quarry near Temecula that would have supplied San Diego.\nMexican construction materials giant Cemex tried for decades to get permits for a quarry in the Santa Clarita Valley but faced fierce opposition from residents and city officials. Now, Cemex is planning to haul rock and sand by rail from its White Mountain quarry in Victorville to a depot in Bell, a 100-mile journey.\nFor Polaris, though, the problem has presented an opportunity. And it\u2019s made the company an acquisition target.\nAlabama concrete giant Vulcan Materials announced plans to buy Polaris in August for just shy of $200 million, a bid that was quickly topped by a $240-million offer from Texas-based U.S. Concrete. The deal would give U.S. Concrete a way to expand into Southern California without the difficult task of buying or building a quarry of its own.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to build a new quarry anywhere in California,\u201d said Brent Thielman, an analyst at brokerage D.A. Davidson & Co. \u201cIt\u2019s the cost of the real estate, the environmental permitting, the regulation. All of that comes with the territory.\u201d\n95051830\nPolaris started shipping aggregate to Long Beach last year, but has been hauling rock and sand to Honolulu and the Bay Area since 2007. The company has said it wants to export to more markets, including San Diego and Ventura County.\nIt\u2019s not the only company importing sand and gravel into the U.S., but the practice remains relatively rare. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that domestic builders used about 1 billion tons of aggregate last year, and that only about 3 million tons were imported \u2014 mostly from Canada.\nBut importing aggregate is more common elsewhere.\nSometimes, it\u2019s the result of a building boom that outstrips local supply. That\u2019s the case in China, which in 2015 imported $2.3 billion worth of sand and gravel, according to United Nations trade statistics.\n\u201cLower quality rock, you hit it with a hammer and it chips, you hit our rock and it rings.\u201d Nicholas Van Dyk, Polaris Materials\nIn other cases, local materials simply aren\u2019t suitable. Qatar and Kuwait were among the top global importers of sand and gravel in 2015, according to U.N. data. There\u2019s plenty of sand in both Persian Gulf nations, but of the wrong sort. Desert sand, formed by wind, is too smooth for making concrete. Coarser sand formed by rivers and glaciers is preferred.\nAnd while logistics is part of the reason Los Angeles builders are buying Vancouver Island gravel, quality is a factor, too. The gravel from the Orca quarry is mostly basalt, a fine-grained volcanic rock that\u2019s harder and denser than the mixture of granite, quartz and schist that are washed out of the San Gabriel Mountains.\nPolaris and its local customers say that makes Orca material a preferred choice for making the high-strength concrete used in the floor slabs of new downtown high-rises and in elements of the forthcoming Rams and Chargers stadium in Inglewood.\n\u201cLower quality rock, you hit it with a hammer and it chips,\u201d said Polaris\u2019 Van Dyk. \u201cYou hit our rock and it rings.\u201d\nWhich is why its L.A. customers are willing to pay a premium.\nOceanwide Plaza, a mixed-use development across from Staples Center, is being built with concrete that includes sand and gravel imported from Vancouver Island. Al Seib / Los Angeles Times\nMaterial from Southern California quarries generally costs $12 or $13 a ton, said Coalson, the quarry consultant. Polaris\u2019 aggregate sells for closer to $20 a ton. But builders say the higher quality material actually saves them money elsewhere.\nAt its most basic, concrete is a mixture of sand, gravel, water and cement. And of those elements, cement is the most expensive, selling for upwards of $100 per ton.\nIf you\u2019re laying down a sidewalk, you can use whatever aggregate you want. But to make high-performance concrete, the materials matter. Use lower-quality sand and gravel and you\u2019ll need to add a larger amount of cement, said Todd Lamberty, a project manager for construction firm Webcor Builders.\n\u201cThe aggregate that\u2019s locally mined is pretty poor quality in terms of its shear strength,\u201d said Lamberty, who is overseeing cement work at several downtown projects using Polaris\u2019 products. \u201cYou end up putting a ton of cement in the mix to make up for that, and cement is the most expensive component.\u201d\nOther projects Lamberty is overseeing include the Metropolis, a luxury condo-and-hotel complex, and Oceanwide Plaza, a mixed-use project, both near Staples Center.\nUsing less cement not only reduces costs but has other benefits. Cement gives off heat as it cures; too much heat can cause shrinking and cracking. Less cement and more aggregate lowers those risks.\n\u201cFor high-strength applications, it\u2019s just kind of a win-win,\u201d Lamberty said.\nAt one of Lamberty\u2019s projects, the apartment building at 12th and Grand, Webcor is using Polaris aggregate for nearly all the structural elements, including floor plates and columns.\nRick Lance, a concrete place and finish superintendent for Webcor, said he has found that concrete with Polaris aggregate cracks less than other mixes. As workers smoothed out freshly placed concrete, Lance plucked a few pieces of gravel out of the wet gray glop.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a jigsaw puzzle,\u201d he said, pointing out the mixture of smooth and jagged faces on each piece of rock. \u201cIt bites better.

Easy to shoot, easy to handle. A used 9mm. For $325 in cash, it was sold to a man who swore in writing on a federal form that the gun was for him.\nIt wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\nWithin days he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d pass the semiautomatic to a friend who had driven him to the store. That friend passed it to others.\nSix days after the Glock was purchased on Aug. 4, 2014, it was used in a gun battle that wounded six at a birthday barbecue a few blocks from Nationals Park.\nIt was fired three days later at a woman driving along a District highway listening to R&B, a victim who happened to be an off-duty D.C. police officer headed home from a nightclub. She kicked off her Louboutin heels and punched the gas pedal trying to catch the shooters.\nThe same night and less than two miles away, the Glock was fired again at a man stopped at a traffic light in a hulking Yukon Denali. In a coincidence, he, too, was a cop and a random target, in plain clothes and driving into the District to testify in a murder trial.\nShot four times, desperately trying to get to his service weapon in a gym bag on his front seat, the officer rammed his SUV into the shooter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s car to try to force it to stop.\nThe officer never managed to fire a round, and the gunman with the Glock got away.\nThe Yukon Denali driven by Detective Thurman Stallings was hit a dozen times by a shooter using a Glock 17 pistol in the District in August 2014. Stallings was hit four times. (U.S. Attorney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Office for D.C. )\nThe Glock 17 was brought to the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capital in 2014, one of 2,178 illegal guns taken off the streets that year by police in the District. Since then, nearly 5,000 more guns have been seized in raids and found during arrests and at crime scenes.\nThe path of the Glock was tracked through court files, interviews, photos, surveillance videos and a 911 call. To follow the saga is to understand the devastation and suffering that just one gun can cause.\nIt changed hands at a rapid pace and traveled across state lines \u00e2\u0080\u0094 stashed in houses, a glove compartment and a flower pot before being tossed under a car in a panicked sprint from police.\nThe Glock was shared in just three months by the two men who started its trafficking at the strip mall and at least five more people who knew how to get to the gun when they needed it and how to pass it off when they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\nThe speed at which guns move from sale to use in a crime is breathtaking, and the Glock\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story demonstrates why law enforcement officials say they often are playing catch-up to the firearms in urban areas. And as the Trump administration and others draw attention to violence in cities, big city mayors and police chiefs point to the easy availability of illegal guns as a driving factor.\n[50 years of U.S. mass shootings: The victims, sites, killers and weapons]\nGuns in high-crime areas \u00e2\u0080\u009care not disposable commodities\u00e2\u0080\u009d and tend to stay within a group even after they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been used in crimes, said Daniel L. Board Jr., who runs the Baltimore Field Division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\nIn recent years, investigators in the District have uncovered what they dub community guns hidden under a refrigerator at a drug stash house and beneath the front stoop of a home.\nBut the ever-more-rapid pace from purchase to street use is ominous even to experts who have tracked firearms for years.\nThe span between when a gun is sold and its use in a crime in the District has shortened every year since 2010, ATF tracking shows, and the number of guns showing up in crimes within three months of their sale has doubled over the past five years.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe bottom line,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Board said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis that when we see those short time to crime spans, our immediate thought\u00e2\u0080\u009d is the link to violent crime.\nHow the number of guns recovered in D.C. compares with other cities Guns recovered per 100,000 people from 2010 to 2016 Orlando 3,960 guns Baltimore 2,578 1,540 Washington, D.C. 908 Los Angeles New York 322 Source: Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives How the number of guns recovered in D.C. compares with other cities Guns recovered per 100,000 people from 2010 to 2016 3,960 guns Orlando 2,578 Baltimore 1,540 Washington, D.C. Los Angeles 908 New York 322 Source: Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\nThe Glock 17 was part of a summer 2014 buying spree.\nIn the span of a month, Jamal Fletcher Baker and his buddy Lawrence Monte Morgan visited five Virginia gun dealers, spending more than $3,500 on a dozen firearms, court files show.\nSometimes they bought two at a time. Sometimes they doubled back to a store within days.\nA Smith & Wesson pistol in Richmond. A Walther Uzi and a Ruger P345 in Ashland.\nAnd at the Manassas store, the Glock.\nBaker and Morgan weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t experienced street hustlers when they teamed up in the gun scheme that authorities said included posting weapons for sale on Instagram.\nMorgan grew up in violent neighborhoods in Maryland and the District. He had no job, was a new father and at the age of 24 was a rapper known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cStunna.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nBaker was raised in a strict military family in Prince George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s County. He was 23 and selling shoes on the street.\nThe two had met a few years earlier while trying to break into the music industry.\nTogether, a court case would show, they went to Virginia Arms Co., about 50 miles from the District, on a late afternoon in early August and from a display, chose the Austrian-made 9mm Glock 17.\nBaker filled out the required paperwork, Federal Form 4473, and declared he was buying the gun for himself \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a lie that is a felony. He quickly gave the Glock to Morgan, the intended owner.\nThe path of the gun 1 Less than a week after Jamal Baker purchases the Glock 17 in Manassas, Va., the gun is used in a shootout at the home of Romeo Hayes near Nationals Park. 2 On Aug. 13, Hayes goes to the Opera Ultra Lounge in downtown Washington with the Glock in a car. 3 Early that morning, Hayes, on Suitland Parkway near Alabama Avenue, uses the gun to shoot at the personal car driven by an off-duty D.C. police officer. 4 At Southern and Pennsylvania avenues in Southeast, Hayes shoots at another car driven by a different off-duty officer. 5 The Glock is later ditched with an illegal gun trader, nicknamed \u00e2\u0080\u009cPoppa,\u00e2\u0080\u009d in an alley behind a public housing complex in Southeast. 6 Police recover the Glock in November after it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tossed under a car during a chase in Southeast.\nThe shootings begin: A party and a firefight\nIn less than a week, the Glock was used in a firefight.\nA birthday party was still going strong just before 2 a.m. on Aug. 10, 2014, at the family home of Romeo and Ronald Hayes in Southwest D.C. within blocks of the baseball stadium.\nAt the back of the brick townhouse on N Street, about a dozen people were at the cookout when a pair of gunmen rolled up in a car on a side street. They jumped out and fired at least 15 rounds. Partiers dove behind sheds and trash cans as the gunmen barged through the yard and toward the house.\nA friend of the Hayeses rushed inside, and according to a police affidavit, grabbed a gun he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recently bought from Morgan. The Glock 17 by then had been tricked out with an extended magazine that held 30 bullets.\nThe friend passed the gun to Ronald Hayes to return fire against the shooters, who had strafed the party in an apparent feud with one of the guests, police would say later in court filings. He missed.\nSix partygoers were wounded, one shot in the neck, stomach, leg and foot. Blood trailed through the kitchen and living room.\nTwo suspects \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not the Hayeses or their friend \u00e2\u0080\u0094 were arrested but charges were not pursued when the suspects, victims and partygoers refused to cooperate with detectives.\nPolice recovered casings from several different guns.\nThree were from a 9mm and were later tracked to the Glock 17.\nA trip to a dance club and then firing on a cop\nLater that morning, the Hayes brothers, the friend who had bought the Glock and a few others regrouped at a house in Prince George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s County, Md., where they hung out for two days, drinking tequila and using drugs.\nSometime after midnight on Aug. 13, Romeo Hayes, then 27, and the friend decided to go clubbing at the Opera Ultra Lounge and drove into downtown D.C.\nBy the time Romeo Hayes and his friend left around 2:30 a.m., he was high and irritable and got into a shouting match with men near his parked car, according to court files.\nThe friend got behind the wheel and they headed to Suitland Parkway to get back to Maryland. Hayes pulled the Glock 17 from the glove compartment.\nOff-duty police officer Shaquinta Gaines left the club at around the same time.\nA mother of two who had known she wanted to be a cop from the time she wore a safety patrol vest in elementary school, Gaines had been out for a girlfriend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s birthday party, dancing in her red-soled shoes.\nShe had left her sidearm at home.\nShaquinta Gaines, a D.C. officer, was off-duty and driving home in 2014 when she was fired on and then witnessed another shooting as she called 911. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)\nAbout six miles from the club, a staccato of dink, dink, dink sounded, interrupting the R&B music Gaines was listening to in her car. As a burgundy Nissan Altima zoomed by, Gaines realized the dinks were gunshots.\nWith her heels kicked off, she put her foot to the gas pedal, surging to nearly 90 mph as she tracked the Altima\u00e2\u0080\u0099s taillights on the parkway.\nCresting a hill, she soon caught sight of the car in the distance locked in what looked like a monster truck battle with a big SUV on Southern Avenue at the D.C.-Maryland line.\nShe sped up, eventually bearing down on the Altima\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bumper, and called out the license plate to a 911 operator just as Romeo Hayes leaned out the passenger side window and opened fire with the Glock 17.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh my God, they shooting again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she told the dispatcher. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what the hell is going on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nGaines ducked until the shooting stopped.\nThe 38-year-old by her own words was \u00e2\u0080\u009cborn and bred in the violence\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the Sursum Corda neighborhood near Union Station. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been on the force for 12 years. But three minutes into her 911 call, her voice had a tremor.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs somebody coming here right now?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nA racing car and, within minutes, a second cop shot\nFrom his Yukon Denali, Thurman Stallings watched a car racing toward him from the rear as he sat at a traffic light.\nThe D.C. detective had left his rural Maryland home before dawn in a T-shirt and sweatpants to get to his police district in Northeast and read up on a new case.\nSeeing the car speeding up behind him at Southern and Pennsylvania avenues, Stallings flipped on his handheld police radio and reached for his pistol in the gym bag on the front seat.\nWhen Stallings looked up again, the Altima had pulled up next to him.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI saw the gun staring right at me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Stallings recalled recently.\nIt was, investigators said, the Glock 17 in the hands of Romeo Hayes.\nThe first shot hit Stallings\u00e2\u0080\u0099s left forearm. It went numb.\nStallings cranked the steering wheel to the left using his right hand.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy goal was, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to stop them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\nDetective Thurman Stallings lives with bullet fragments too risky to be removed even after multiple surgeries to repair the damage left by the Glock 17. One fragment is near his heart. He has never asked how close. (Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post)\nHe hit the gas hard, ramming the front of his SUV into the passenger side of the Altima.\nRomeo Hayes fired again, driving gaping holes into Stallings\u00e2\u0080\u0099s windshield. Twelve bullets pierced the SUV, four hitting Stallings in the left shoulder, stomach and chest before the Altima pulled away.\nStallings stayed behind the car for only a few more blocks before he saw flashing police lights headed to the scene.\nDizzy, he came to a stop as officers rushed to the 27-year veteran, talking to Stallings and fighting back tears as they put pressure on his wounds and waited for the helicopter that would lift him to a trauma center.\nBy then, the Altima \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the Glock \u00e2\u0080\u0094 were gone.\nDoctors removed a bullet from Stallings\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forearm but left bullets in a shoulder and his abdomen.\nA fragment too risky to remove remains near his heart.\nStallings has never asked how near. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be honest, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really want to know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAs recently as this spring, Stallings underwent more than 20 hours of surgeries because of the bullet lodged in his abdomen and spent more than two months in a hospital.\nAt 53, he has learned to walk again and is fighting to return to full duty. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to let those guys retire me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Stallings said of his attackers.\nBullets pierced the Nissan Maxima driven by off-duty officer Shaquinta Gaines in a run of shootings tracked to a Glock 17.

The friend of the Hayeses sped in the Altima back to the Prince George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hangout with Romeo Hayes, and, according to court documents, told Ronald Hayes, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think your brother just killed someone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nRomeo Hayes demanded the car keys, telling his brother he wanted to buy gasoline to \u00e2\u0080\u009cblow the car up\u00e2\u0080\u009d and took off, the files show.\nPolice in Prince George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s County quickly spotted the Altima with its badly damaged passenger side and chased it into the District, where D.C. officers joined a high-speed pursuit covering four miles until Romeo Hayes then jumped out in Northeast. He ran through back yards of the Deanwood neighborhood, breaking a wooden picket fence as he dodged officers and the spotlight of a hovering police helicopter.\nFinally hemmed in by a warren of fences and buildings, he sat on the porch of an elderly woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home, where police nabbed him.\nRomeo Hayes told police he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d just left a club in downtown and had done nothing wrong.\nHe was arrested and charged with two counts of assault with intent to kill.\nThe Glock 17 wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t on him.\nBlind alleys and a gun trader named \u00e2\u0080\u0098Poppa\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nRebecca Tomlinson and Michael Brittin came together on a case for the first time in the aftermath of the Glock 17 shootings.\nAn agent for a decade with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Tomlinson often teams with D.C. police and prosecutors in gun trafficking investigations.\nBrittin has spent more than three decades prosecuting major crimes for the U.S. Attorney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Office for D.C.\nOn the day the two officers were attacked, Brittin, a meticulous senior prosecutor, took over the investigations. Romeo Hayes was in custody in the District and the friend who had driven the Altima was quickly arrested. Tucked into the friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s waistband was a Ruger P345 pistol, one of the guns purchased in the summer buying spree in Virginia.\nThe friend told D.C. investigators about another gun \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a Glock 17 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that he had pulled from a hiding spot in a flower pot and taken to an underground gun trader in the District called \u00e2\u0080\u009cPoppa.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe friend, who was never named in open court because of concerns for his safety, said he had told Poppa \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe gun was dirty\u00e2\u0080\u009d and Poppa assured him \u00e2\u0080\u009che could switch it out for him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nFederal investigators searched for the Glock 17 and an underground D.C. gun trader known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cPoppa\u00e2\u0080\u009d in an apartment in Woodland Terrace in Southeast D.C. (U.S. Attorney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Office for D.C. )\nThe capture of the Ruger also caught the attention of the ATF when it flashed up on a report highlighting quick turnaround times between a gun\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legal sale and its seizure during a criminal investigation.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have a lot of people sharing and stashing illegal guns\u00e2\u0080\u009d within crews, and in neighborhoods beset by crime \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou know you can pick up one if you need it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tomlinson said.\nShe and her colleagues set to work tracking the sale of the Ruger. Using the serial number, the ATF traced it to a sporting goods store in Ashland, Va., court records show, and to the Ruger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s buyer of record, Jamal Baker.\nVirginia State Police databases and records from firearms dealers served up more details: Baker had bought a dozen guns in his own name during an August buying binge.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe quickly realized this was a huge problem,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tomlinson said.\nSurveillance footage from some of the Virginia gun buys showed Baker was not alone during the purchases. But when ATF investigators went to Baker, he would not name his partner.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I had stayed the hunted and not become the hunter, I would not be here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d D.C. police detective Thurman Stallings, left, told the judge overseeing the case of the Glock 17 prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael D. Brittin, right. (Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post)\nBrittin, meanwhile, wanted the Glock. Interviews and crime scene analysis had confirmed that 9mm casings at the birthday party and the attacks on the officers had all come from a Glock 17.\nWhen Brittin learned of Poppa, he got a search warrant and investigators scrambled. But the search at Poppa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s place came up empty.\nBrittin painstakingly scoured internal daily police reports, looking for firearms recovered from crime scenes.\nAs Brittin struggled to find the Glock, Tomlinson asked federal prosecutors for help identifying Baker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gun-buying partner. The request led her, in December 2014, to Brittin.\nHe arranged for her to interview Romeo Hayes\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friend and driver.\nHe told Tomlinson that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d bought the Ruger and the Glock from the man in the surveillance video, Baker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s partner. The friend said the man was a rapper named \u00e2\u0080\u009cStunna,\u00e2\u0080\u009d pulling up his music videos on an iPhone.\nBut who was \u00e2\u0080\u009cStunna\u00e2\u0080\u009d really?\nLaw enforcement teams stopped at music recording studios and a concert and got nothing on Stunna before a social media posting exposed him as Lawrence Monte Morgan, investigators said.\nHe was soon arrested. Investigators didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t turn up the Glock.\nTomlinson had privately assumed the Glock had been made to disappear as part of the cleanup in the days after the shootings but had asked to be alerted if any gun Baker had purchased surfaced at a crime scene.\nAnd she waited.\nBrittin continued plowing through internal police reports.\nFrom Tomlinson, he had learned the Glock\u00e2\u0080\u0099s serial number: CME244.\nAnd he waited.\nThey got their hit in the early days of 2015.\nThe Glock had been tossed under a car after a police chase by a man whose relatives lived in Poppa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s housing complex.\nThe serial number had been obliterated in three places, but the ATF still could make out all but the second character. It looked like an H, but maybe it was an M.

        "text": "Share to twitter\nShare to linkedin\n3D printing production is still in its infancy, but it is already inevitable. And if you look closely, you will find numerous indications that this historic shift is already well underway.\nFor the last decade, 3D printing has been the playground of the maker community, while commercial applications have been limited to prototyping. But now, industrial 3D printing has reached its tipping point, and is about to go mainstream in a way that will revolutionize the economy.\n3D production of functional end-use parts is already one of the fastest growing areas in the manufacturing sector. In 2014, a PWC survey found that 11% of manufacturing companies had already switched to volume production of 3D printed parts or products.\u00a0 As costs continue to drop and quality rises, it will be impossible to put this genie back in the bottle.\nHere are seven ways that 3D printing production is already in use today and disrupting business as we know it.\n1. True Rapid Prototyping. 3D printing has been used for nearly 20 years to create physical replicas of new part or product designs. Often referred to as rapid prototyping, this process has typically been anything but rapid, with service providers often taking a week or more to deliver a single piece. But recent breakthroughs in automation coupled with the entry of global distribution companies like UPS have changed everything, in some cases leading to same-day production and shipping. These changes are dramatically collapsing design cycles. A product that would need a month to go through three or four design changes in the prototyping phase now takes a week. Products are getting to market faster, and companies are saving significant time and money.\n2. Rapid Design Iteration (A/B testing of physical products). 3D printing has moved beyond prototyping into first-run production, allowing for true market testing and rapid design iteration. Witness Ford: For most of the company\u2019s existence, engineers had to create a brand new mold if they wanted to test a prototype engine. The process would typically take six months and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Today, Ford is 3D-printing these molds in four days at a cost of $4,000. Taking advantage of this enormous reduction in time and cost, Ford recently decided to make not just a single engine prototype for a new car, but numerous versions to be tested simultaneously.\u00a0No longer bound by the constraints of the old industrial process, engineers can explore dozens of variations and rigorously test them all, fine-tuning the engine\u2019s performance.\nThe result of advances in 3D printing production will be an eventual blurring of the lines between prototype and product. Smaller companies will reap great benefit from this technology, introducing innovative products without huge inventory expense. Multiple versions of industrial parts or even consumer goods can be tested for use in the marketplace\u2014the ultimate focus group. The sort of A/B testing that is constantly done in the digital world is now possible in the physical world.\n3. Low volume production.\u00a0With conventional manufacturing, a company has to commit to creating tooling or molds before a single end use part can be produced. If creating a mold costs $50,000 and each incremental part costs $.50, then the very first part will cost $50,000.50!\u00a0 This works out fine if you are producing millions of parts. But what if you only need 500? With 3D printing, there are no set-up costs whatsoever. Today, for production runs of less than 1,000 items, most companies will consider 3D production as a cost effective alternative. (Fast forward to the inevitable and not-so-distant future when prices for 3D printing production have dropped 95% or more, and \u201cMade in China\u201d tags are a collector\u2019s item.)\n4. Mass Customization.\u00a0 Until recently, if you needed to have your knee replaced, a nurse would bring a box directly into the operating room and the doctor would select one of the five possible knee designs that she felt most resembled your knee. Today, your actual knee is scanned and a perfect replica is printed and ready for you prior to surgery. This is an example of mass customization \u2013 where large quantities of an item are produced, each one customized. Invisalign has built a multi-million dollar business producing teeth alignment devices using 3D printing to completely customize every single device. With customization comes premium pricing (aka the Starbucks skinny mocha latte frappuccino vinni vicci). Nearly every company I talk with is exploring how to introduce product customization to better serve customers and increase profits.\n5. Virtual Inventory. Manufacturing companies making a new product typically also manufacture a multi-year supply of spare parts, producing large quantities that are expected to meet demand for 10 years or more. But holding inventory is very expensive. Costs include the capital to produce the inventory, shrinkage (where parts are simply lost or stolen), obsolescence, warehousing, insurance, tracking and distribution. What is your company warehousing? How many times per year are those parts needed? Why not simply print them on demand instead? With 3D printing production, you make what you need, when and where you need it. Virtual inventory improves the efficiency of every business that uses anything manufactured. Inventories around the world will soon shrink dramatically as virtual inventory goes mainstream.\n6. The Long Tail of Parts.\u00a0 3D printing not only disrupts the initial stages of production where years\u2019 worth of inventory is created; it fundamentally changes how companies view the end of a product\u2019s life. Today, a ten-year-old refrigerator that works fine mechanically but is missing two shelves or a door seal would most likely be scrapped. After a decade of service, all the spare parts produced for it are depleted. The manufacturer will consider the product \u201cdead,\u201d and will no longer service it.\u00a0 But with 3D production, you now have \u201cthe long tail of parts.\u201d \u00a0Hold on to the digital design files, and you can print any part for as long as it is needed. Older but still-useful products don\u2019t become waste; their lifespan need not be pre-determined by scale production limitations. The \u201clong tail\u201d fundamentally changes the way designers and engineers are thinking about and planning for a products existence well into the future.\n7. Product Innovation Renaissance. 3D printing\u2019s lower entry barriers and ability to enable radically more complex and useful objects are initiating a new era of product innovation. The rush of design possibilities will eventually compel existing companies to rethink nearly all of their current products. Companies are already replacing traditionally-manufactured items with 3D printing production, taking advantage its superior design capacities and flexible production schedule. As highlighted in the first article of this series, GE is using 3D metal printers to produce its fully redesigned new fuel injection system for jet engines, reducing components from 21 parts to 1 and incorporating geometries that are simply impossible to create using any other manufacturing method, resulting in astonishing increases in efficiency. This innovation renaissance will only accelerate as companies move beyond redesigning existing products to creating new products that today are unimaginable.\n* \u00a0 * \u00a0 *\nWe find ourselves at a key inflection point in history. The possibilities of growth and innovation are endless, and companies have already begun to seize on what is possible today. But the current uses for 3D printing in production are what email was to the Internet in 1994: an example of the incredible utility of a new technology, but also, merely a glimpse of the sweeping changes to come. In the next and final article in this series, we will all take an eye-opening step forward and see what it might be like to live in a 3D printed future.

        "text": "Sep 14, 2017 | 12:35 PM\nJ.P. Donleavy in 1993. (Associated Press)\nJ.P. Donleavy, the incorrigible Irish American author and playwright whose ribald debut novel \"The Ginger Man\" met scorn, censorship and eventually celebration as a groundbreaking classic, has died at age 91.\nDonleavy, a native New Yorker who lived his final years on an estate west of Dublin, died Monday in Ireland. His death was confirmed by personal assistant Deborah Goss.\nAdvertisement\nThe author of more than a dozen books, he sometimes was compared to James Joyce as a prose stylist, but also was admired for his sense of humor. \"The Ginger Man,\" first published in 1955, sold more than 45 million copies and placed No. 99 on a Modern Library list of the greatest English language fiction of the 20th century.\n\"The Ginger Man' has undoubtedly launched thousands of benders, but it has also inspired scores of writers with its vivid and visceral narrative voice and the sheer poetry of its prose,\" American novelist Jay McInerney wrote in the introduction for a 2010 reissue.\nWhen the novel was published, authorities targeted its profanity and graphic sexual content. It was banned in Ireland and the United States. Several publishers rejected the book before it was acquired by Paris-based Olympia Press, which specialized in explicit and avant-garde materials. To Donleavy's fury, Olympia released the book through an imprint dedicated to pornography.\n\"The Ginger Man\" is an ambling, picaresque tale about the adventures of Sebastian Dangerfield, an American in Dublin after World War II who neglects and abuses his wife and child, mooches off his friends, bilks his landlords, drinks wherever he can run up a tab and rarely lets a woman's appearance go unnoticed.\n\"I have discovered one of the great ailments of Ireland, 67 percent of the population has never been completely naked in their lives,\" Sebastian observes. \"I am bound to say that this must cause a great deal of the passive agony one sees in the street.\"\nOften cited as prophetic of the cultural revolution of the 1960s, \"The Ginger Man\" sold so well that it enabled Donleavy to buy Olympia after he and the publisher spent years suing each other over rights to the book.\nThe author initially had less success adapting \"The Ginger Man\" for the stage. The play opened in London in 1959 with Richard Harris as Dangerfield, but closed within days in part because of objections from the Roman Catholic Church. A New York production starred Patrick O'Neal, who later opened a Manhattan restaurant and named it after Donleavy's book.\n\"The Ginger Man\" is also among the most prominent novels never to have been made into a feature film, although those trying included Robert Redford, Mike Nichols and Johnny Depp.\nDonleavy, a bearded, green-eyed man who spoke with an Anglicized accent, never lost his affinity for odd and provocative behavior. Cornelius Christian, the protagonist of \"A Fairy Tale in New York,\" arrives at U.S. Customs with his wife's body in a box. In \"A Singular Man,\" the wealthy George Smith composes a will that calls for his estate to be auctioned off and the proceeds \"converted to banknotes of small denominations and placed in a steel receptacle six feet high and one foot in diameter.\"\nReviewing \"A Singular Man\" in 1963 for the National Observer, a little known Hunter S. Thompson praised Donleavy as a \"humorist in the only sense of the word that has any dignity,\" one \"forever at war with despair.\"\nSebastian Dangerfield was based on a classmate at Trinity College, but Donleavy seemed to share many of his vices, telling the Associated Press in 1992 that at school \"I took my degree in drinking and harlotry in the finer pubs of Dublin.\"\nHe was married (and divorced) twice and was nonchalant when interviewers noted that his second wife twice conceived children with other men. He became an Irish citizen in middle age after the government granted artists tax-exempt status.\n\"Money, above all things,\" Donleavy responded when asked by the Paris Review in 1975 about his motivations. \"Fame goes, but money never does. It's got its own beauty. It's never gone to ashes in my mouth. I've always exquisitely enjoyed it. And maybe a little bit of revenge.\"\nThe son of Irish immigrants, James Patrick Donleavy was born in New York City, wrote poetry as a child and had some early success as a painter before turning to fiction in his early 20s. As he explained to the Paris Review, he thought the novel was his quickest path to fame and set out to write a book that would \"shake the world.\"\nAdvertisement\nDonleavy served in the Navy during World War II, attended Trinity in the late 1940s and began working on \"The Ginger Man\" soon after. The author would endure a wave of rejections and recalled a visit to the Boston offices of Little, Brown and Company, which had recently published of J.D. Salinger's \"The Catcher In the Rye.\"\n\"The editor called me around there on a hot, sweaty afternoon,\" he told the Paris Review. \"He sat me a good distance away from his desk, and the manuscript was in a shadowy corner of the room. He leaned back in his chair very nervously and pointed at the manuscript, with his hand trembling, and said, 'There's obscene libel in that book!' So that was the end of Little, Brown.\"\nDonleavy lived long enough in Ireland to absorb his adopted country's dark humor about mortality. \"When I die,\" he once wrote, \"I want to decompose in a barrel of porter and have it served in all the pubs in Dublin.\" Another time, he composed an epitaph in rhyme:\n\"When I'm dead, I hope it may be said: his sins were scarlet, but his books were read.\"\nEssential California Newsletter",

        "text": "A'Dorian Murray-Thomas had a chance to study abroad in Madrid this summer, which she says would have allowed her to become fluent in Spanish.\nBut the senior from Swarthmore College, a small, liberal arts school in Pennsylvania, passed up that opportunity to pursue what's turning out to be her niche.\nMurray-Thomas, 20, is passionate about civic and social responsibility, and that's why she chose to stay in Newark, her hometown, to mentor a group of city girls whose lives mirror her own experiences.\n\"This was of chief importance,'' she says.\nLike Murray-Thomas, many of the 12- and 13-year-old girls have lost family members to violence. Don't worry, though, there's no need for pity.\nThis is about a sisterhood among 12 girls who didn't know one another a month ago. When they first met at Newark's Hayes Park West Recreation Center, some were shy and didn't want to mingle. Now, after spending time with Murray-Thomas, you can't keep them apart.\n\"If one person doesn't have something, we make sure we give to each other,'' says Malayjah Williams, 11.\nGive it up for their big sister, who, in such a short time, has become the person they look to for guidance - hanging onto her every word.\n\"You can tell her anything and she won't tell anyone,'' says Shariah Brown, 11. \"Because of her, I'm learning how to love myself and have more respect for myself.''\nAt a minimum, Murray-Thomas is in their lives three days a week through a program she developed and funded with a $10,000 scholarship from Swarthmore.\nThe program is called \"SheWins,'' and the name of the nonprofit organization reflects what's been happening with the girls.\nThey are winning because they are confident. They see the value in asking questions. And they have Murray-Thomas to thank - all because she did not go to Spain. She believes in giving back to Newark and, especially, young girls - who need someone other than family members to help them.\n\"SheWins\" may have started this summer, but Murray-Thomas could see it becoming a reality when she was a high school senior, listening to Swarthmore officials talk about the Eugene M. Lang Opportunity Scholarship.\n\"They actually gave kids money to do something that mattered,'' she says.\nMurray-Thomas was among six students selected last year to receive the scholarship money, which she uses to operate the program. But the application process began in her sophomore year; she was one of 70 applicants who wrote proposals to address a social problem. That would have been 2013, when there were 10 murders in 10 days in Newark when she came up with he idea to help girls impacted by violence.\nThe crime spree made her think of her dad, a Guyanese immigrant who was shot and killed in Newark by a teenager when was she just 7-years-old.\nShe wasn't able to contextualize the underlying issues back then, but now she can.\n\"Would he (the kid) have picked up the gun if the opportunities he had were different?'' she asks.\nWas it a lack of education? Or was it poverty and cycles of violence, she says, that caused the young man to rob and kill her dad.\nThrough this program, Murray-Thomas teaches the girls how to be leaders in both community service projects and by making them aware of social justice issues regarding class and equality. No topic is too heavy, including any that may have been the reasons for lost souls to gun down others.\nWhat matters to Murray-Thomas is that \"SheWins\" helps girls such as 13-year-old Aaliyah Bellamy to cope when her niece was killed.\"When you lose somebody, you're depressed and it feels like there's no future,'' Aaliyah says. \"This shows how you can bounce back.''\nThat's what Murray-Thomas has done and she has not wasted anytime keeping the girls busy. Her group was among 225 girls from around the world who heard Michelle Obama speak during a girls' empowerment conference in Washington, D.C. Murray-Thomas chaperoned the trip, along with three youth summer interns from the city, which provided the transportation. She paid for the gas and food with money from the scholarship.\nIn case you haven't noticed, it is all part of the norm for Murray-Thomas to be in the mix. She gets it from her mother, Dana Murray, who was always on the go, seeing to the circumstances of foster kids in her caseload when she was a social worker.\nAt Swathmore, Murray-Thomas is co-president of the Black Student Union and a peer counselor. When she's not in class - she's studying political science, with a minor in black studies and education - Murray-Thomas plays lacrosse and works with fifth- to seventh- graders in an alternative suspension program near her college.\nThe end of August will be tough for Murray-Thomas, when she leaves the girls to return to Swarthmore.\"Those are my babies,'' she says.\nThey'll miss her, too, but not for long. She set up the \"SheWins\" program so that she can come home once a month in the fall to be with them.\n\"I'm drawn to it,'' she says. \"I don't even know if I had a choice.''\nProbably not, but that's a good thing.\nBarry Carter: (973) 836-4925 or bcarter@starledger.com or nj.com/carter or follow him on Twitter @Barry CarterSL",

They chanted \u201cDo your job!\u201d and ended the night by screaming \u201cYour last term!\u201d\nDemocrats insist it is not normal to have foreign interference in a presidential election, that Trump\u2019s financial conflicts of interest are unprecedented, and that robust oversight is necessary when you have a president who seems intent on doing whatever he wants. They openly wonder how is it that the oversight committee has no current plans to investigate Trump.\nDemocrats offered seven Trump-related amendments \u2014 covering issues ranging from the Trump Hotel lease with the General Services Administration to legal restraints on the president\u2019s ability to issue executive orders \u2015 to the committee\u2019s oversight plan. Chaffetz and Republicans on the committee adopted zero of them.\n\u201cBefore, he was saying he was waiting for him to get sworn in,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cHe got sworn in. Then he said he was willing to give him a chance to get his cabinet set. So we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\u201cEverything I\u2019ve seen so far, doesn\u2019t sound like he feels there is much to investigate,\u201d the top Democrat on the oversight committee, Elijah Cummings of Maryland, told HuffPost this week.\nTwo years into his tenure as chairman, Chaffetz has proven he can work better with Democrats than Issa. But that is maybe the lowest standard of bipartisanship on Capitol Hill. And in the early stages of the Trump presidency, there are hardly any signs Chaffetz will work with Democrats to conduct any real oversight of Trump.\nChaffetz \u2015 a fresh-faced, calmly spoken 49-year-old who was a placekicker for Brigham Young University in the late \u201880s \u2015 was one of President Barack Obama\u2019s most outspoken critics. He won the oversight committee\u2019s chairmanship in late 2014 by promising aggressive investigations but also a more bipartisan approach than the deeply politicized style of his predecessor, Darrell Issa (R-Calif.).\n\u201cGive it a few days, for goodness sake!\u201d Chaffetz told The Huffington Post this week. \u201cAll the flailing before he was even sworn in was a bit silly, if not purely immature.\u201d\nBut now that it\u2019s President Donald Trump\u2019s administration Chaffetz is charged with monitoring, he\u2019s willing to sit back and wait.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a target-rich environment,\u201d he said in late October . \u201cEven before we get to Day One, we\u2019ve got two years\u2019 worth of material already lined up.\u201d\nWASHINGTON \u2015 When Rep. Jason Chaffetz, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, thought Hillary Clinton was going to be president, he could barely wait to start investigating.\nOn Thursday, to his credit, Chaffetz did take a hard stance against the administration. Earlier in the day, Kellyanne Conway promoted Ivanka Trump\u2019s clothing line during a morning Fox News hit from the White House. Later in the day, Chaffetz said the endorsement was \u201cclearly over the line\u201d and \u201cunacceptable.\u201d He and Cummings eventually sent a scolding letter referring Conway to the Office of Government Ethics for an investigation.\nThe other issue the media has given Chaffetz credit for looking into is the unprecedented situation with Trump Hotel, where Trump is both the tenant and now, technically, as the head of the federal government, the landlord. Trump is leasing the Historic Old Post Office from the government, and the contract clearly states that no elected official \u201cshall be admitted to any share or part of this lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom.\u201d\nWhen HuffPost asked Chaffetz about the Trump Hotel lease in late November, he said the tenant-landlord situation was \u201ctrue of every president,\u201d pointing to payments the Secret Service makes when agents are housed on the property of their protectees. Chaffetz suggested he saw no difference between those situations and a contract explicitly prohibiting an elected official from being party to a $180 million lease.\nBut Chaffetz recently asked the GSA for an unredacted version of the contract, suggesting he might actually see a problem there, that maybe he\u2019s interested in real oversight of Trump after all. Or maybe not.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t term it an investigation,\u201d Chaffetz said, \u201cbut I am curious as to what the GSA plans to do, if anything, about it.\u201d\nAnd if you didn\u2019t think Chaffetz saw this as a minor issue that the GSA, not Trump, needed to resolve, he also said there was \u201cprobably an easy, simple remedy.\u201d\n\u201cBut I\u2019d like to hear from them what they think that is,\u201d he continued.\nDemocrats point out they have already sent GSA multiple letters asking for additional information about the Trump Hotel lease. If Chaffetz were really serious about aggressive oversight and working through this issue, they charge, why did he only ask for an unredacted version of the lease and not the other information committee members sought? Why aren\u2019t lawmakers holding a hearing?\nPart of the reason may be that Chaffetz believes the president, as Trump told the New York Times, can\u2019t have conflicts of interest.\n\u201cThe president is exempt from conflicts of interest,\u201d Chaffetz said. \u201cHe is exempt. That\u2019s the law. And Democrats are flailing and that\u2019s about all they have at this point.\u201d\nA short report issued by the Congressional Research Service in late November concluded that, yes, presidents are not subject to the same rules on financial conflicts of interest as the rest of the executive branch. But that same report also said Trump is \u201cpotentially\u201d subject to the Emoluments Clause in the Constitution, which prohibits officeholders from taking any gift from a foreign state.\nChaffetz, however, appears dead-set on not poking around into Trump\u2019s finances. He notes he never did a personal investigation into Obama or Clinton \u2015 that he only probed issues surrounding their government service \u2015 and he doesn\u2019t sound eager to go after Trump.\nIn fact, the person who Chaffetz has seemed to go after most aggressively this year is the director of the Office of Government Ethics, Walter Shaub. Chaffetz sent Shaub a stern letter accusing him of \u201cblurring the line between public relations and official ethics guidance\u201d when Shaub\u2019s office tweeted about Trump\u2019s potential conflicts of interest. Chaffetz demanded a meeting with Shaub, even threatening to subpoena him when a meeting did not work out. (Emails between Chaffetz\u2019s office and OGE seemed to show that the botched sit-down was more Chaffetz\u2019s fault than Shaub\u2019s.)\nIn a scrum with reporters during the GOP retreat two weeks ago, Chaffetz downplayed his feud with the ethics chief. \u201cI just think he stepped out of bounds a little bit,\u201d he said. But he made it clear during that session with the press just how uninterested he is in investigating the president.\nWhen he got a question about the White House demanding to review scientific reports before they are sent out publicly, Chaffetz dismissed the question by noting he had not heard about the issue. When he got a question about Trump using an unsecured phone, he said he didn\u2019t know about that either, and he wondered what Obama had done. When a reporter answered that Obama had a secure BlackBerry, Chaffetz made a joke.\n\u201cBlackBerry? What\u2019s that?\u201d he said, moving on to the next question.\nWhen another reporter asked about Trump\u2019s insistence that there was massive-scale voter fraud, Chaffetz did say he saw no evidence of that, but he also added that Trump was free to use the Department of Justice to investigate. When a reporter asked whether that might be wasteful, and whether Chaffetz could do an investigation on that waste, he shrugged.\n\u201cI\u2019ve kind of given you my position on it. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m pursuing,\u201d he said.\nOn Tuesday, Trump summoned Chaffetz to the White House for a meeting. Chaffetz said he had no idea why Trump wanted to see him, but Chaffetz later reported that Trump made it clear he didn\u2019t want to talk about oversight.\n\u201cBefore my bum even hit the chair, the president said, \u2018No oversight. You can\u2019t talk about anything that has to do with oversight,\u2019\u201d Chaffetz said. Instead, they talked about Chaffetz\u2019s reform agenda, including civil service reform and the Postal Service, an aide told HuffPost. But first, they began the meeting by discussing the Bears Ears Monument in Utah.\nOver the objections of local politicians, Obama designated roughly 1.35 million acres in San Juan County, Utah, as a national monument. Chaffetz and the rest of the Utah congressional delegation want Trump to reverse that action, as locals worry that the designation might prevent them from collecting firewood or visiting sacred sites to perform religious ceremonies.\nTrump could help Chaffetz by reversing Obama\u2019s decision \u2014 and win a favor down the road. There\u2019s nothing necessarily wrong with a member of Congress advocating for the interests of his state. But Trump\u2019s transactional view of the world might present problems for the lawmakers who are supposed to keep him in check. And it\u2019s just remarkable to see a relationship developing between Trump and Chaffetz, given where they were a few months ago.\nOn the day that a recording came out of Trump bragging he grabs women by their genitals and forcibly kisses them without their consent, Chaffetz was the first congressional Republican to say, \u201cI\u2019m out.\u201d\n\u201cMy wife and I,\u201d Chaffetz told a local news station on Oct. 7, \u201cwe have a 15-year-old daughter, and if I can\u2019t look her in the eye and tell her these things, I can\u2019t endorse this person.\u201d\nHe called Trump\u2019s words on that \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape \u201csome of the most abhorrent and offensive comments that you can possibly imagine,\u201d and he said he didn\u2019t know who he\u2019d vote for, only that it wouldn\u2019t be Trump or Hillary Clinton.\nThat\u2019s not the end of the story, though. Less than three weeks later, Chaffetz had a change of heart.\nHe tweeted that while he wouldn\u2019t \u201cdefend or endorse\u201d Trump, he would vote for him. He had apparently figured out how to look his daughter in the eye.\n\u201cI asked her who she\u2019d vote for and she said Donald Trump,\u201d Chaffetz told HuffPost this week.\nHe again reiterated that he saw a difference between endorsing someone and voting for them, and he expressed his relief that Clinton had lost.\n\u201cI\u2019m just thrilled beyond anything that it\u2019s not Hillary Clinton,\u201d Chaffetz said. \u201cI\u2019m just thrilled that we\u2019re not calling her President Clinton.\u201d\nChaffetz punctuated that point on Inauguration Day, when he posted a picture on Instagram of he and Clinton shaking hands with a caption that read: \u201cSo pleased she is not the President. I thanked her for her service and wished her luck. The investigation continues.\u201d",

        "text": "When teaching research methods to first-year college students, I used to tell them that scientists try to prove themselves wrong. But last year, I took that out\u2014it felt too dishonest. At its best, science is about figuring out where we\u2019re wrong, about constant course correction.\nUnfortunately, the pressures society has placed on scientists have made it almost impossible for us to admit when we\u2019re wrong. We\u2019re rewarded\u2014by funding agencies, by prestigious scientific journals, by the media\u2014for cherry-picking and polishing our results to make them look as shiny as possible. \u201cGroundbreaking\u201d discoveries are often the standard for getting a job or getting promoted. When the stakes are that high, it\u2019s easy for scientists to start seeing what we need to see\u2014to convince ourselves that our embellished findings are rock solid because we have to. What\u2019s worse, there is little incentive for scientists to challenge and correct each other. Doing the hard work of checking each other\u2019s discoveries is not glamorous. And when scientists bother to do it, the response is rarely gratitude\u2014instead, efforts to point out legitimate errors in methodology are often met with accusations of bullying. Indeed, science\u2019s dirty little secret is that scientists are often actively hostile to the very mechanism that science depends on: self-correction.\nAdvertisement\nThe story of Amy Cuddy, as told in a recent New York Times Magazine story, illustrates why self-correction is so rare in science. In painting a moving portrait of Cuddy\u2019s life over the past few years, it conflates Cuddy\u2019s experience as the target of scientific criticism with her experience as the target of something much more vicious and universal: actual bullying. Susan Dominus\u2019 piece centers around the replication crisis, the \u201crevolution\u201d in psychology whose aim is to improve the rigor of psychology research (the revolution that, according to the title of Dominus\u2019 piece, came for Cuddy, one of the researchers behind the power-posing finding that has failed several replication attempts). As Dominus writes, \u201cCuddy, in particular, has emerged from this upheaval as a unique object of social psychology\u2019s new, enthusiastic spirit of self-flagellation\u2014as if only in punishing one of its most public stars could it fully break from its past.\u201d As an example of this zeal for taking Cuddy down, Dominus describes a blog post written by Joe Simmons and Uri Simonsohn, saying, \u201cCuddy felt as if Simmons had set them up; that they included her TED talk in the headline made it feel personal, as if they were going after her rather than the work.\u201d\nThese characterizations frame the blog post in question as a personal attack, motivated by a desire to punish Cuddy. But when I read it, what I see is a well-reasoned criticism of a scientific claim\u2014exactly the kind we need more, not less, of. Scientific journals will sometimes publish findings that turn out not to be true (I know\u2014I\u2019ve been an editor at several journals and I\u2019ve made mistakes). That\u2019s OK, as long as we have a mechanism for correcting the record. And the kinds of critiques that Simmons and Simonsohn wrote are our best hope for correction. It\u2019s understandable that the criticism felt personal to Cuddy\u2014when we critique a scientific claim, we are necessarily saying that the people making it are wrong. But as painful as it may be, this type of criticism is completely appropriate, and even necessary, for science to proceed.\nCuddy\u2019s story is an important story to tell: It is a story of a woman living in a misogynistic society, having to put up with internet bullies who I have no doubt have cruelly and unreasonably criticized her life and career. But it is also a story of a woman experiencing completely appropriate scientific criticism of a finding she published. Conflating those issues, and the people delivering the \u201cattacks,\u201d does a disservice to the fight for gender equality, and it does a disservice to science.\nWe live in a world where women who rise to the top almost invariably must endure systematic harassment and threats of assault along the way. Being a public figure demands heroic levels of bravery from them, particularly given that women are still underrepresented in positions of leadership. But if we are going to deal with this problem, and tackle the harassment women face in their fields, this requires us to be clear about the line between criticism and bullying. Blurring the line by painting scientific disagreement as bullying dilutes these efforts and makes it harder to tackle the problem. It sends the message that any disagreement with a woman could be seen as an attack, and it makes it easier for women\u2019s claims of harassment to not be taken seriously.\nIf scientists who scrutinize each other\u2019s work are painted as bullies (or worse, sexist bullies), scientific criticism will become radioactive\u2014no scientist in her right mind will go anywhere near it. This would have terrible consequences for science. Social science has the potential to help people, to make society more just, but we\u2019ll only get there if someone does the hard work of verifying and replicating promising leads and, when necessary, correcting our errors. Finding solutions to society\u2019s problems requires a robust social science that is full of criticism and debate.\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "Waiting for modern eyes to see was the rock-filled cribbing that was the base of a dam that spanned the river immediately downstream of the present day U.S. Highway 212 bridge in Granite Falls. The \"old power dam\" as it was called in a 1900 plat book may have been built as early as 1871. It's base had been hidden underwater for 108-years by the higher waters the Minnesota Falls dam had created when it was built in 1905.\nThe now revealed, old dam became an immediate problem, according to Chris Domeier, fisheries supervisor with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources in Ortonville. It was just high enough to make boating and canoeing dangerous on this section of the river.\nIts presence also served to hinder fish migration, and took away the natural riffles and rapids that provide important habitat for fish and other aquatic organisms in the river.\nAdded to these issues was the way the old dam diverted the river's flow to the west bank of the river, scouring it and in the long term, potentially creating concerns for the Highway 212 bridge.\n\"The issue became, who is going to take care of it?'' said Domeier.\nHe spoke last week as the problem was taken care of, and in a way that will benefit boating, canoeing and fishing in the river in a very big way. It took three days of work in the river to restore the old dam site into a more natural rapids area.\nHigh water flows in the river had delayed the project for nearly two years. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers held water back at Lac qui Parle Lake to aid the work this season.\nA grant from the Lessard Sams Outdoor Heritage Fund made the project possible, said Domeier, in large part because of the benefits it will provide for fish in the river.\n\"This is the best lake sturgeon spawning habitat in the Minnesota River,'' said Domeier as he pointed to the V-shaped rapids created below the Highway 212 bridge.\nDr. Luther Aadland with the Minnesota DNR, who has built an international reputation for restoring fish habitat when dams are removed from riverine systems, oversaw the restoration. Its goals are to restore the spawning habitat needed by the river's rock stars: Lake sturgeon, paddlefish, walleye, and sauger among them.\nThe stretch of river that exists from the former Minnesota Falls dam to the Granite Falls dam is unique in the Minnesota River system, according to Aadland. The approximate 17-foot drop in elevation along the stretch creates a series of riffles and rapids. Boulders are naturally dispersed in the stretch. Combined with the relatively steep drop, it makes perfect habitat for a wide variety of fish, including many of the small, forage fish on which game fish feed.\nIt also means there is an approximate, 250-mile stretch of the Minnesota River from the Granite Falls dam to the Mississippi River that is free flowing. That makes it one of the longest, free-flowing river stretches in the entire state.\nAadland has been part of research that is showing that fish naturally migrate long distances in river systems. Radio tags have tracked sturgeon that migrated in the Mississippi River from near the Iowa border to locations in the Minnesota and St. Croix Rivers to find the spawning habitat they need. They returned to the waters near Iowa within two weeks, indicative of how important the right spawning habitat is for this species.\nThere are walleye in the Missouri River system that annually make 200 mile migrations.\nAadland said he has little doubt that once discovered, this newly-restored site will attract many fish species for spawning.\nHe noted too that the removal of the Minnesota Falls dam has removed a barrier to fish migration, and reduced the river fragmentation that has kept many species of fish from upstream habitat they once occupied. Since its removal, 12 of the 39 native species that had been blocked have now returned upstream, according to a study published in 2015.\nThe study found that the Granite Falls dam keeps 39 native species from returning to natural, upstream habitat. The city and the DNR are exploring the possibility of developing a fish passage at the dam site.\nAnglers have already discovered the improved fishing opportunities now found upstream of the former Minnesota Falls dam site, noted Domeier. He anticipates that in the next couple of years, they will also discover that some of the best fishing in the river will be found right where the newly-restored rapids are found.",

This builds off of Part I where we discussed the gender disparities in venture capital, and how solving for those issues creates great financial opportunities for investors, as well as assuring our country\u2019s economic competitiveness.\nIn Part I of our series, we talked about the value of women investing in women-run VCs as a first step towards fixing the gender imbalance of the 99% male \u201ctrue VCs\u201d in venture capital -- and thereby unlocking the higher financial returns of women-led companies. Although this is where we see the beginning of the solution from our personal experience at True Wealth Ventures , individual investors alone can\u2019t move the needle far enough. This Part II delves into what it is really going to take to achieve industry-wide change, which is not being discussed amidst all of the \u201clack of women\u201d in VC.\nEllen Pao, chief diversity and inclusion officer at the Kapor Center for Social Impact, speaks during a Bloomberg Television interview in San Francisco, California, U.S., on Monday, Sept. 25, 2017. Pao discussed Silicon Valley's gender diversity issues. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg\nThe vast majority of investment dollars in the venture capital industry come from \u201cinstitutional investors.\u201d These are organizations such as pension funds, university and nonprofit endowments, foundations and other financial institutions. They deploy capital as limited partners (LPs) to venture capital funds\u2019 general partners (GPs) to invest in early stage, high growth companies to earn an investment return. According to PitchBook data, last year institutional investors accounted for 75% of all U.S. VC deal flow versus family offices. The current investment policies of these institutions perpetuate a cycle of investing that not only immortalizes the gender imbalance , but also results in missing out on the financial outperformance of first-time, smaller and diverse VC funds.\nBecause institutional investors are fiduciaries of other parties\u2019 money they, understandably, have strict policies around how they choose fund GPs. These large LPs face limited manpower to execute due diligence (sometimes one person per billion dollars under management), making ongoing relationship management for each individual investment challenging while deploying large pools of capital.\nTherefore, they generally set a minimum investment size in the tens or even hundreds of millions, and often don\u2019t want to or cannot be more than a certain percentage of a given fund (to avoid taking a controlling interest). This means they don\u2019t even consider smaller funds (e.g., less than $100M), and most first-time funds are smaller. (Note: This is partly due to a chicken-and-egg situation of these institutional investors not investing in smaller funds and an SEC limit of a maximum of 99 accredited investors per fund, regardless of investment size.)\nAccording to Preqin data , the ability to predict future fund performance based on historical performance has not panned out. In fact, over 15 years (2000-2014), the data has demonstrated the outperformance of first-time funds in comparison to legacy funds.\nIn practice though, these institutions typically invest in a small group of established funds because they can point to the fund\u2019s reputation and past performance. In other words, they only invest in the same fund managers and well-known funds which is currently estimated to be 99% male VCs. When they do consider first-time funds, they traditionally require what\u2019s known as an \u201cattributable exited track record\u201d of returns. Which translates to GPs who\u2019ve already worked at prior firms as the investment decision-makers and long enough for the underlying portfolio companies to have been acquired or IPO\u2019d (traditional funds are 10-12 years long to accommodate for the time it takes for the portfolio companies to exit.) Do you see the conundrum? With only 1% of the investment decision-making VCs in the industry being women, that makes for very few who can spin out to form a new firm and qualify under these criteria. Not to mention that the institutions also want the partners of the new firm to also have worked together for a significant tenure at a prior fund.\nTrue Wealth Ventures\nTrue Wealth Ventures\nThese factors all compound to inhibit new and diverse GPs from entering the venture capital sector at any scale. Unfortunately, even the institutional investors who have \"emerging manager\u201d or \u201cminority manager\" programs have these challenging fund size and track record restrictions. If institutional investors don\u2019t change their approach, the current gender imbalance won\u2019t change for decades -- and these institutions will continue to miss out on the financial benefits of diversity. This is a missed financial opportunity since the data shows that newer funds , smaller funds , and investments in women-led companies (in which gender diverse GPs tend to invest), all outperform.\nSo, what do we propose these institutional investors do?\nFirst, truly engage in programs focused on new and diverse managers by dedicating resources to diligence and invest smaller size checks into newer, smaller, and more diverse funds. Their resulting return rates should be higher, and by helping to scale these funds, they can help grow these financially outperforming opportunities.\nIncorporate a new set of criteria to assess the viability of the new firms\u2019 GPs (beyond exited track record.) These criteria should include the GPs technical, operational and entrepreneurial accomplishments, which may have better correlations with choosing successful portfolio companies and supporting them to a successful exit.\nChallenge established VC funds by demanding more transparency from all GPs into their diversity strategy -- such as requiring performance metrics on the gender impact of their investments. We proposed how gender impact could be standardized and measured in this Kauffman Foundation-funded work we have been supporting, both in the number of\u00a0women partners making investment decisions at the VC funds and women-run portfolio companies.\nA viable next step is to engage the institutional investors with a third-party who can step in and create a Fund of Funds (FoFs) model which will pull together a team dedicated to the diligence and management of these smaller funds with women GPs, as VC firms with women partners are twice as likely to invest in companies with a woman on the management team and three times more likely to invest in companies with women CEOs as discussed in Part I . The FoFs model has been widely used for institutional investors who are looking for an outsourced option to deploy capital into venture funds to achieve risk reduction through portfolio diversification. Through our research and experience, it seems there is a big opportunity to form a FoFs specifically focused on smaller, women-led funds. As we have seen from our personal experience at True Wealth Ventures, it is largely women LPs who are initiating the change and setting the ball, and the institutional investors need to push the dollars over the tilting point and the spike the ball. It\u2019s a big ask, but these steps by the largest players behind the venture capital sector are the only way to achieve i ndustry-level change to the VC industry\u2019s gender imbalance in any reasonable time frame. But the change needn\u2019t be painful, given the financial upside possible from such new policies. The smart players should recognize this, take the lead and reap the rewards. Perhaps Melinda Gates states it best, \u201c The change we need will require bold leadership from the industry\u2019s power brokers...limited partners, I\u2019m looking at you.\u201d\nFor the full report with updates and commentary visit SumZero , the world's largest network of buyside investors.

        "text": "Darwin Martinez Torres (right) has been indicted in the murder of 17-year-old Nabra Mohmod Hassanen (left). (Left: Photo courtesy of Isra Chaker, Right: Photo, Fairfax Co. Police)\nFAIRFAX, Va. (AP) -- A northern Virginia man accused of killing a 17-year-old Muslim girl as she walked back to her mosque is now facing a possible death penalty after an indictment Monday charging him with capital murder and rape.\nThe June slaying of Nabra Hassanen, who had been out with friends eating a meal ahead of pre-dawn Ramadan services, rattled the region's Muslim community. More than 200 supporters wearing \"Justice for Nabra\" T-shirts showed up at a preliminary hearing Friday for the man charged in her death, 22-year-old Darwin Martinez-Torres of Sterling. The hearing was delayed when Nabra's parents had to be restrained from charging at Martinez-Torres. Nabra's mother threw a shoe at him.\nPolice had said previously they were investigating whether Nabra had been sexually assaulted, but Monday's indictment is the first time that prosecutors brought sex-crime charges of any kind against Martinez-Torres.\nVirginia law allows prosecutors to pursue a death penalty only under certain conditions. Those include murder in the commission of a rape and murder during an abduction with intent to defile.\nThe seven-count indictment handed up Monday actually includes four counts of capital murder, spelling out in sometimes graphic detail the ways in which prosecutors believe the slaying qualifies for the death penalty.\nPolice have said Hassanen was out with a group of more than a dozen friends at about 3:40 a.m. June 18. The group was walking back to their mosque, the All Dulles Area Muslim Society, after eating at a McDonald's ahead of a daylong fast. Observant Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset during Ramadan, which this year coincided with the summer solstice. As a result, teens from the mosque sometimes went out for fast-food meals in the overnight hours between the late-night and early morning prayer services.\nPolice say Martinez-Torres encountered the group and got into a confrontation with some of the kids who had been in the roadway. Martinez-Torres chased after the group and caught Hassanen, at one point bludgeoning her with a baseball bat, police said.\nIn a search warrant affidavit, police say Martinez-Torres admitted killing Nabra and that he led them to where he had dumped her body in a nearby pond.\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights group, is representing Nabra's family. CAIR lawyer Gadeir Abbas said the family \"is focused on ensuring that there is justice for Nabra and that the murderer is held accountable for his crimes. This tragedy has affected the family, but also the Muslim community across the country, coming as it did during Ramadan when the kids were gathering at the mosque to socialize and for prayer.\"\nSome Muslim activists called for hate-crime charges. Police and prosecutors said they have seen no evidence of anti-Muslim bias that would warrant such a charge.\nDawn Butorac, the public defender appointed to represent Martinez-Torres, did not return a call Monday seeking comment.\nView the court documents in full below:",

        "text": "It seems that virtually every day Donald Trump and his administration are embroiled in a new fiasco. The Mueller investigation is ongoing, indictments are coming out, and the president can\u2019t help himself from picking fights on Twitter. His targets run the gamut, from the New York Times and CNN, to NFL players and ESPN hosts. There\u2019s even friendly fire directed at fellow Republicans like Mitch McConnell and Ed Gillespie.\nWhat Trump may not realize\u2014and what new data shows\u2014is that he may be tweeting his way into losses in 2018 and 2020.\nStory Continued Below\nTen months into his presidency, the failure of any one single scandal to sink his administration has led some in the media to suggest that Trump is like \u201cTeflon,\u201d with the grime that would stick to (and ruin) other politicians simply slipping right off. But the numbers show that nothing could be further from the truth\u2014Trump\u2019s scandals aren\u2019t just damaging him, they\u2019re causing swing voters to reevaluate both his priorities and the very health of the economy.\nThe Messina Group recently completed a long-term research project looking at a specific group who helped decide the 2016 election: white voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin who supported Barack Obama in 2012 but in 2016, did not vote for Hillary Clinton, instead choosing to either stay home or vote for Trump or a third-party candidate. What we found\u2014combined with this month\u2019s election results\u2014should worry Trump and every ally who has hitched their wagon to his fast-burning star.\nAmong the swing voters most critical to his viability, Donald Trump isn\u2019t just vulnerable, he\u2019s harming himself. Even as Wall Street reaches new highs in profitability and Trump endlessly brags about his stock-market numbers, these voters aren\u2019t seeing the improvement in their own lives. And, most worryingly for Trump and Republicans, the president\u2019s outlandish statements cause the voters we spoke with to believe that he\u2019s focused more on his own petty dramas than on improving their families\u2019 lives.\nTrump\u2019s behavior and the endless parade of controversies he drums up? They\u2019re how he loses.\n***\nAt the beginning of April, we convened an online focus group of voters in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania who supported Obama but not Clinton. The overriding opinion expressed by the participants was that, yes, Donald Trump was racist, sexist, and offensive, but he was shaking up Washington and working to improve the economy. As one woman in Michigan put it, Trump \u201cwants to change things that everyone has been complaining or talking about for years.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a belief that was underlined by the results of our polls from both July and October, which showed that key voters in these three states gave Trump much higher marks on his handling of the economy than his job approval\u2014among this subset of voters, a late October poll had Trump at a net -23 points on job approval but only -7 on handling the economy. This trend is consistent with what public polls are showing; in the latest NBC/WSJ poll from the end of October, Trump\u2019s job approval was -20, but his rating for handling the economy was +5.\nThat said, the white Obama-Non-Clinton voters we surveyed were clear: If the economy does not improve measurably, they are not going to give Trump a second chance\u2014and they already have a clear reason to explain his failure: Twitter.\nConsistently, the members of our focus groups worried that Trump was so pre-occupied with picking Twitter fights and the general chaos of his administration that he was not focusing on making the economy better. This sentiment is backed by quantitative data that offers a peek at Trump\u2019s political kryptonite.\nBased on the focus-group findings, we drafted four distinct messages about Trump and his handling of the economy. In one, we explained that he had stacked his cabinet with billionaires who weren\u2019t looking out for everyday Americans; in another, we offered facts about the economy under Trump, including stagnant wages; in the third, we highlighted how Trump\u2019s budget would cut programs important to the middle class and reroute the money into tax cuts for the wealthy. And finally, we tied his incendiary, all-hours tweets to his failure to bring jobs back to the U.S.\nWhen exposing all voters in the survey to a tough message laying out the consequences of Trump\u2019s tweeting\u2014how it signals what he really cares about and prevents him from focusing his energy on making good on his promises to improve people\u2019s lives\u2014we found that the overall rating of Trump\u2019s handling of the economy dropped by 6 points. And among the key Obama-Non-Clinton voter demographic? It dropped a staggering 21 points.\nSimilarly, when voters were told that Trump wants to give massive tax cuts to the wealthy while cutting programs for middle-class families, voters\u2019 ratings of his handling of the economy sunk by 8 points overall and by an astounding 24 points among Obama-Non-Clinton voters.\nPerhaps even more interesting is that when we re-surveyed Obama-non-Clinton voters six weeks later, those who\u2019d been exposed to the tweeting message had a much dimmer view of Trump than those exposed to other messages.\nThe real-world application of these findings is clear: Voters might give President Trump a pass for individual outrageous statements, but if Democrats continually tie his pattern of remarks back to the economy, voters will not be forgiving. Progressives across the country should be driving this message relentlessly: Donald Trump is more focused on helping the rich and picking fights on Twitter then he is with making people\u2019s lives better.\nSince we started this research back in March, a debate has developed within some of the Democratic Party about whether we should focus on the white working-class voters or what pollsters call the \u201crising American electorate,\u201d which is usually defined as Millennials plus people of color and unmarried women. And while I hope the recent election\u2014in which Democrats rode a cresting tsunami of enthusiasm and engagement into office from coast to coast\u2014will quell this debate, I want to reiterate that Democrats don\u2019t need to adopt an either/or strategy, treating support from each group as though it\u2019s mutually exclusive. Barack Obama won two presidential elections because he focused on both, and going forward, Democrats would be wise to remember the lesson of his example.\nIt\u2019s true that Donald Trump is unlike any politician we have seen in a long time. Things that pundits say should sink him do not. He has thus far managed to rebound from even the most vile behavior.\nBut voters are only willing to go along with that so far.\nWhen they realize that he is failing to deliver on the economy, the heap of fiascos he has piled up becomes evidence of what he has focused on instead. And then, Trump will be held accountable, just like every other politician.\nJim Messina is president and CEO of the Messina Group, and managed President Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection campaign.",

        "text": "A startup is a journey of questions with as yet unidentified answers. Most startups fail because they never find true enough answers to succeed. Startups succeed when the founders are focused on finding the truest answers to their most important problems.\nWhat is the best way to engineer a product that will delight customers? What is the most efficient channel to get that product into your customer's' hands? What is the most effective way to scale up that model to maximize the impact and commercial success of the business? Who are the right leaders to help achieve these goals? Even small questions seek \"truth\" \u2013 What color button on a website is most likely to convert the customer?\nWhile there isn't a single \"truth\" that is the correct answer to any of these questions \u2013 each fork in the road has more and less true answers. The job of the founder and leadership team is to find the truest path to success. Unlike large companies operating at scale, at a startup the unknowns are overwhelming, and data cannot by itself resolve most of these decisions.\nMost team leaders will agree on the majority of decisions that need to be made and good startup teams seem telepathic at times, but there are inevitably going to be profound disagreements. It's critical that entrepreneurs embrace these conflicts because solving them properly is often the difference between success and failure.\nIf the decisions were easy, someone would have made them already. The conflict exists because the answers aren't obvious. It's in the conflict that the right answers emerge. You have to lean into the conflict to win.\nConflict Failure Modes\nAvoiding the Conflict\nI believe the most common conflict failure mode at a startup is when the leadership disagrees on what should happen, but no one speaks up because it's uncomfortable to do so. The team is in full denial that there is even disagreement on the hard choices that need to be made. As a result, these choices aren't made at all and the leadership of the company makes the wrong decisions while pretending that everything is okay. Inevitably, after the company fails, leadership team members lament that they knew that the company was going in the wrong direction and should have spoken up sooner. Yes, they should have.\nEgo\nEgo makes conflict painful because we try to avoid hurting others' feelings, while protecting our own. But for many, winning the argument becomes more important than the company making the right decision. Therefore, when we engage conflict, we become emotional and want to win for ourselves, confusing this emotion with our desire to win collectively. While each of us struggles with this tension, the problem is exacerbated by the fact that everyone in the debate naturally is subjective on the superior value of their perspective. This tendency can often lead to anger, insecurity, and unnecessary emotion that makes conflict painful, relationship threatening and unproductive. Unfortunately, ego frightens many team members to shift into conflict avoidance.\nStrong Personalities vs. Wall Flowers\nOften in ego-driven conflict, stronger personalities will win despite having no greater insight on the truth. It is crucial for a company to make sure that conflict is not resolved simply by the strength of personality. Otherwise, the company will have a scenario where personal victory \u2013 \"I need to be right\" \u2013 comes before company victory \u2013 \"we need to be right.\" The wallflowers have no less claim on the truth of their market, operation, or product. They often just have less eagerness to fight.\nSoftening The Edges\nIn polite conversation with friends and relatives, we are all taught to soften the edges of our conflict. In other words, we pretend that we mostly agree, even when we don't. This adaptive approach to conflict at least arguably makes sense in a social setting. We can politely agree to disagree largely because in social settings we don't have to collaborate to make critical decisions. At startups, softening the edges can be catastrophic. It causes leaders to work in opposite directions or procrastinate making the hard decisions.\nRevert to Mean\nEmpathy is often misapplied in a startup context. It's great to embrace the idea that everyone's opinion counts, but critical to understand that these opinions do not yield equally correct outcomes. The inability to decisively move forward, and instead find a middle ground on each topic, leads to Frankenstein solutions that rarely yield the correct answer. In this way, the startup prioritizes compromise over finding truth. If there is always a more true answer and team members are in conflict on what that answer is, there is little probability that the compromise answer is the right one. While everyone might feel good that their point of view was persuasive to a consensus outcome, they will feel much worse when they realize that compromise and truth have little in common at a startup.\nHow to Embrace Conflict\nIt's easy to say that a company should embrace conflict and far harder to do so successfully. Ultimately, engaging conflict is among the most significant cultural challenges for startups, but also among the most important.\nReframe Conflict As The Search for Truth\nMost people don't think about a startup as a search for truth. It's important to frame the quest of the startup this way and make sure that everyone understands that the purpose of a startup is experiment constantly in the service of finding the best answer to pressing problems. Everyone has the right to question the assumptions and no one has a monopoly on being correct \u2013 yet in aggregate the company making the right decisions will make or break its success.\nCall out Objectivity and Subjectivity\nCompanies need to build a culture where it is okay to question whether a colleague is being fully objective. By acknowledging the natural human tendency toward ego, it should become okay to check with colleagues whether their judgment is being clouded by their own need to win the argument, versus their desire to find the right answer. By being willing to engage in this type of self-reflection and giving others the license to question you, egos can be moderated.\nBe Hard on Problems, Not People\nRemind everyone that it is the problem, not the people, that should be the focus of the conflict. When team members start to attribute negative intentions and motives to their colleagues, it becomes very difficult to put ego aside and focus on finding the right answer. By being soft on people and hard on problems, the company can build trust as the basis for the exercise of doing the hard work of making decisions collectively, rather than playing the ego game.\nWhile maintaining empathy for individuals, the culture shouldn't have empathy for ideas. The best ideas can come from anywhere in the organization, from the CEO to the most junior team members, and everyone should be speaking truth to power at a startup. Having said that, everyone must accept that not all ideas are equal. Being respectful of everyone's contributions is often confused with valuing all ideas as equally likely to be truth. Every single idea has a relative truth value to all others and must face that crucible.\nDebate, Don't Fight\nEgo turns conflict into a fight. The goal is to avoid the fight, but engage the debate. Try to be objective and curious about others' points of view. Listen to each other and work toward finding the truth. Keep debating until you find it and work hard to parse differences in assumptions and beliefs. The challenge is to build a culture where team members work as hard as possible to defuse the fight by showing enthusiasm for the debate.\nHard decisions take time and deserve intense debate, but when debate becomes a fight, it's time to take a break and calm the negative energy. When taking a break, always address when the debate will continue, or breaks can often slip into conflict avoidance.\nGauge Magnitude of Beliefs\nSome people just like to argue for the intellectual value, even if they don't feel strongly about a particular outcome. Others are stubborn and don't like to lose arguments, on principle. Both of these instincts must be subordinated. However, there is often truth in the magnitude an individual feels about an issue. Those who are effective at subverting their egos, but feel very strongly on a hypothesis, often have strong insights powering the magnitude of their belief. It's important to listen to those who feel most strongly \u2013 particularly when they are not the strongest personalities at the table.\nConsider Hierarchy & Roles\nOn teams where debate becomes unproductive, drawing lines around areas of responsibility can help. Deference to greater experience, domain knowledge, or responsibility for the outcome are all reasonable solutions for many debates. Let anyone add to the debate, but in many cases it is best to leave the decision to the responsible party. Note that this approach can be risky\u2014if an individual pulls rank too often and he'll find himself without a partner or team, and will often lose credibility in the next debate.\nAt Some Point, The Debate Must End\nTruly convincing or being convinced of the best decision for the company is the optimal path to resolve a conflict, but it is not the only way. Sometimes a team has sincerely delved into the differences as much as possible and is running out of time to make a decision. In those cases, the company must find a way to pick a direction and move forward as one. Constant dissent on the decision, once made, can be as problematic as not engaging the conflict in the first place. After the decision has been made, the company needs the benefit of a single team moving forward together.\nGet Out Of The Way\nWhen a decision is made, everyone must lock arms and move forward or simply get out of the way. We've seen many circumstances where talented team members needed to part ways after a high-quality debate, because they simply couldn't agree on how to move forward. Sometimes startup leaders must accept that if they aren't part of the solution, they are part of the problem.\nYou're Paid For Your Opinion\nI had a boss who frequently repeated the statement, \"you're paid for your opinion.\" He was encouraging energetic debate by trying to draw out the wallflowers and build a culture where the stronger personalities learned to listen. Crafting this type of culture is the key to a successful team. Studies have shown the difference between good marriages and bad ones isn't the lack of fights, but learning how to fight productively. This is also true for startup teams.\nA CEO who believes he is always right, and rams decision making through an organization, will create a culture of people who feel frustrated, suppressed, and will regularly make poor decisions. A CEO who integrates dissent and healthy debate into the company will be primed for success and likely find the truth she is seeking.",

Several members of that team took fraudulent \u201cpaper\u201d classes.CreditElsa/Getty Images\nBy Marc Tracy\nOct. 13, 2017\nCHAPEL HILL, N.C. \u2014 The N.C.A.A. did not dispute that the University of North Carolina was guilty of running one of the worst academic fraud schemes in college sports history, involving fake classes that enabled dozens of athletes to gain and maintain their eligibility.\nBut there will be no penalties, the organization said, because no rules were broken.\nIn a ruling that caused head-scratching everywhere except Chapel Hill, the N.C.A.A. announced on Friday that it could not punish the university or its athletics program because the \u201cpaper\u201d classes were not available exclusively to athletes. Other students at North Carolina had access to the fraudulent classes, too.\nNoting that distinction, the panel that investigated the case \u201ccould not conclude that the University of North Carolina violated N.C.A.A. academic rules,\u201d the N.C.A.A. said in a statement.\nThe N.C.A.A.\u2019s determination was a major victory for North Carolina after years of wrangling and uncertainty. The athletic department \u2014 one of the most high-profile and lucrative ones in the country, and a source of deep pride in the state \u2014 could have faced severe penalties, including the loss of championships in men\u2019s basketball, its signature sport.\nThe N.C.A.A.\u2019s committee on infractions concluded it lacked the power to punish the university under the rules of the N.C.A.A., an association that expects members to govern themselves and establishes a wide berth when it comes to determining what qualifies as academic progress.\n\u201cN.C.A.A. policy is clear,\u201d said Greg Sankey, the commissioner of the Southeastern Conference, who led the panel. \u201cThe N.C.A.A. defers to its member schools to determine whether academic fraud occurred and, ultimately, the panel is bound to making decisions within the rules set by the membership.\u201d\nCarol L. Folt, the university\u2019s chancellor, welcomed the ruling, pointing to the process the university underwent with its accrediting body as well as reforms it instituted internally. \u201cI believe we have done everything possible to correct and move beyond the past academic irregularities and have established very robust processes to prevent them from recurring,\u201d she said.\nAccording to a university-commissioned investigation, North Carolina had for nearly two decades offered a \u201cshadow curriculum\u201d of fake classes into which athletes were steered. It appeared to be a stark subversion of the N.C.A.A.\u2019s central tenet that college athletics are a mere component of education.\nThe scheme involved nearly 200 laxly administered and graded classes \u2014 frequently requiring no attendance and just one paper \u2014 over nearly two decades in the African and Afro-American Studies Department. Their students were disproportionately athletes, especially in the lucrative, high-profile sports of football and men\u2019s basketball. They were mostly administered by a staff member named Deborah Crowder. In many cases, athletes were steered to the classes by athletics academic advisers.\nThe scandal was so serious that the university\u2019s accreditation body briefly placed the university on probation.\nIn its notice of allegations, which is the N.C.A.A. equivalent of a lawsuit or an indictment, the N.C.A.A.\u2019s enforcement staff pointed to the high enrollment of athletes in the classes \u2014 nearly half, according to the university-commissioned investigation led by Kenneth L. Wainstein \u2014 and emails in which advisers requested spots for athletes. It charged North Carolina with a \u201clack of institutional control\u201d resulting in violations of bylaws governing extra benefits to athletes and ethical conduct.\nU.N.C. had contended that the case was fundamentally academic in nature, and that athletics staffers were at most tangential to it. The university cited instances in which similar misconduct was alleged at Auburn and Michigan, and the N.C.A.A. did not act.\n\u201cThe fact that the courses did not meet our expectations,\u201d Mark Merritt, the university\u2019s general counsel, said in a call with reporters, \u201cdoesn\u2019t make them fraudulent.\u201d\nIn a tone that seemed begrudging at times, the panel accepted that reasoning.\n\u201cWhile student-athletes likely benefited from the so-called \u2018paper courses\u2019 offered by North Carolina, the information available in the record did not establish that the courses were solely created, offered and maintained as an orchestrated effort to benefit student-athletes,\u201d Sankey said.\nSankey added that his panel was \u201ctroubled by the university\u2019s shifting positions about whether academic fraud occurred on its campus,\u201d but he said the infractions committee was powerless to punish North Carolina for courses the university offered to any member of the general student body.\nThe panel said it had to take North Carolina at its word.\nCritics of the N.C.A.A. cited the ruling as another exhibit in their case that the college sports establishment is primarily interested in maintaining the amateur model while keeping revenue flowing, at the expense of athletes\u2019 educations.\n\u201cIf ever there was a case of academic fraud, North Carolina would have to be the poster child \u2014 the longevity and the outrageous behavior to keep athletes eligible through systematic fraud,\u201d said Gerald Gurney, a professor at the University of Oklahoma and past president of the Drake Group, which seeks to reform college athletics. \u201cAnd it leads one to the absolute conclusion that this finding sanctions academic fraud among our institutions for the purpose of keeping athletes eligible.\u201d\nBut others believe the N.C.A.A. made the proper decision because the organization is not designed to judge the legitimacy of individual institutions\u2019 academic programs.\n\u201cI have never believed that a significant part of the N.C.A.A.\u2019s governance and membership was comfortable with the N.C.A.A. coming in and saying, \u2018We are going to determine what is an appropriate academic arrangement for athletes,\u2019 because of the slippery slope it goes down,\u201d said Tyrone P. Thomas, a lawyer at Mintz Levin who advises colleges and universities on N.C.A.A. matters.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a massive loophole,\u201d he added, \u201cand from the P.R. side it looks horrible \u2014 these athletes can do what they do, and it looks horrible. But guess what? Maybe that\u2019s not the N.C.A.A.\u2019s job. This is something the schools have always self-regulated.\u201d\nTo those who wished the panel had punished North Carolina, the panel itself offered an implicit rejoinder, telling the \u201cmembership\u201d \u2014 the association is made up of over 1,000 colleges and universities \u2014 that if it wished to condemn what happened at North Carolina, it needed to write such rules.\n\u201cIt is more likely than not that student-athletes received fraudulent credit by the common understanding of what that term means,\u201d the panel said. \u201cIt is also more likely than not that U.N.C. personnel used the courses to purposely obtain and maintain student-athletes\u2019 eligibility. These strong possibilities, however, are not the operative or controlling starting points to the membership\u2019s academic fraud analysis.\n\u201cWhat ultimately matters,\u201d it added, \u201cis what U.N.C. says about the courses.\u201d\nCorrection:\nA picture in an earlier version of this article was published in error. It showed North Carolina\u2019s 2017 national championship team, not the 2005 championship team.\nKevin Draper contributed reporting.\nA version of this article appears in print on , on Page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: N.C.A.A.

I subsequently talked to her twice in September.\" They later met at village hall on Oct. 3, he said.\nLindberg disputed that, saying, \"Anyone who knows our group knows that we jump on these things. I would have started (efforts to save the depot) right then and there.\"\nIn those prior conversations with Carroll, she said moving or demolishing the building was \"never mentioned.\"\n\"If we had more time, this would have been easier. But the way we were given notice, forces us to move the building twice,\" she said. \"The village knew this, and did not work with us.\"\nNoting that the railroad played a \"pivotal role\" in the development of the community, and the depot sits on land once owned by the Haven family, Lindberg said she initially hoped the depot could remain on site, near the tracks, to create a rail museum and a meeting place for veterans' groups that the historical society plans to work with.\nBy operating in the evening, it would not have interfered with commuter traffic and parking, she said.\nAccording to Janine Farrell, historic preservation manager for the Will County land use department, two other depots in Will County have been preserved, relocated and landmarked \u2014 in Beecher and Wesley Township \u2014 and neither one is near an active commuter rail line.\nIn his letter to Lindberg, Orseno said the old depot \"cannot be repurposed on-site as there will not be an available parking area for a new use.\"\nCarroll previously said that it would be \"too costly\" to rework the utilities to serve a building that would get little use.\nThe CVS Pharmacy, which will be situated directly in front of the existing train station, will have \"all new utility improvements,\" he said. Church Street, which leads directly to the old station, will be vacated to make room for the retail project.\nVillage officials had hoped that by moving the new station further east, the gates would no longer impede traffic on Cedar Road, as they do now, when a train arrives from Chicago.\nBut correspondence from Metra to New Lenox officials indicated that the proposed location of the new station is still too close to Cedar Road to allow the gates to be up for westbound trains.\nThe village bought nearly 3 acres of land at this corner, and is expected to close on its sale of 1.6 acres to CVS for $1.7 million in January, Carroll said. The rest of the land was sold to Heidner Properties for a Fleckenstein's Bakery and Durbin's Restaurant.\nWhile 60 parking stalls will be temporarily lost during the construction, they will be replaced with the building of the approved Lincoln Station apartment complex, east of the train station, Carroll wrote in a letter to Corrao in March, 2016.\nslafferty@tribpub.com\nTwitter @SusanLaff",

        "text": "CHICAGO (Tribune News Service) \u2014 As the threat of deportation becomes more imminent for a U.S. Army veteran with a green card and felony drug conviction, lawmakers and clergy this week ramped up efforts to keep him in the U.S.\nOn Thursday, U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, using a little-known legislative maneuver intended to help specific individuals, introduced a private bill, requesting relief for Miguel Perez Jr., 39, who served two tours in Afghanistan but has no access to veteran benefits and has been ordered to return to his native Mexico.\n\u201cTo prevent this disgraceful treatment of a veteran who risked his life on behalf of our nation, I filed a private immigration relief bill on his behalf,\u201d Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, said in a statement. \u201cMr. Perez deserves the opportunity to stay in the country he was raised in and subsequently signed up to defend. He has close family ties to the United States and removal would have a serious adverse impact on the health of this combat veteran and that of his family.\u201d\nPrivate bills have been introduced by dozens of members of Congress this past year seeking to aid constituents with immigration issues. Their success rate is generally low, but Duckworth hopes the gesture alone will bolster Perez\u2019s case.\nPerez is awaiting deportation in a Wisconsin detention center. He began a hunger strike last week, saying that his abstinence from solid food is not only a protest of his situation, but also a prayerful fast to bring back other veterans who already have been deported.\n\u201cGod has given me a new sense of living,\u201d Perez said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a purpose, and my purpose is those guys right now.\u201d\nHe said a chaplain intervened on his behalf Wednesday when guards threatened to place Perez in solitary confinement, barring phone calls and visitors.\nNicole Aberico, a spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, did not confirm whether immigration officials had made such a threat to Perez. She said in a statement that once a detainee skips nine consecutive meals, officials explain the negative health effects of not eating. For detainees\u2019 safety, ICE closely monitors their food and water intake, she said.\n\u201cIn general, ICE fully respects the rights of all people to voice their opinion without interference,\u201d Aberico said. \u201cICE does not retaliate in any way against ICE detainees who implement religious fasts or hunger strikes.\u201d\nEarlier this week, Perez\u2019s parents received word that Gov. Bruce Rauner had denied a pardon for their son, which advocates had hoped would encourage the government to grant citizenship to Perez, dating back to when he joined the military in 2001. His attorney, Chris Bergin, applied for citizenship on Perez\u2019s behalf in July.\nThat retroactive application for citizenship is the only pathway left for Perez after federal appeals judges denied a request for relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture, a protection similar to asylum. Perez and human rights advocates believe he would be in danger if he were sent back to Mexico, where he hasn\u2019t lived since he was 8.\nPerez is one of many legal permanent residents who have served in the U.S. military, then faced the possibility of deportation to their native countries after committing a crime. As with others, Perez mistakenly thought he became a U.S. citizen when he took an oath to protect the nation. He said superiors never offered to help him expedite his citizenship.\nAfter his military service, Perez sought treatment at the Veterans Affairs hospital in Maywood, where doctors diagnosed him with post-traumatic stress disorder. He was supposed to return for more tests to determine whether he also had a traumatic brain injury. In the meantime, he reconnected with a childhood friend who provided free drugs and alcohol.\nOn the night of Nov. 26, 2008, while with that friend, Perez handed a laptop case containing cocaine to an undercover officer. Perez pleaded guilty to the drug charge and served half of a 15-year prison sentence. When legal residents or people who are here illegally commit crimes, ICE\u2019s standard procedure is to let them serve most of their sentence for the crime in the U.S., then deport them.\nPerez discovered the citizenship oversight when he was summoned to immigration court shortly before his release from Hill Correctional Center in Galesburg. Instead of heading home to Chicago from prison, Perez was placed in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\nBut as Perez\u2019s options for staying in the U.S. narrow, his plight continues to gain attention from those sympathetic to his cause.\nIn addition to the bill introduced Thursday, Duckworth introduced several bills in August intended to prevent veterans and members of the military from being deported or denied health care. The proposed bills would bar the deportation of veterans, give legal permanent residents a path to citizenship through military service, establish naturalization offices at military training facilities, and bolster health care services for veterans.\nIn the House, U.S. Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, a Democratic congressman from Texas, said he would seek to amend a proposed Repatriate Our Patriots Act to cover Perez and others like him. Proposed by Gonzalez last year, the bill is the first bipartisan effort to address the issue. It is co-sponsored by Alaska Republican Don Young, the longest continuously serving member of the House, and Rep. Bobby Rush, a Chicago Democrat.\n\u201cThe American government breached a contract with green card vets,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cI don\u2019t consider this an immigration bill. I consider this a veterans bill. This is for American soldiers.\u201d\nmbrachear@chicagotribune.com\n\u00a92018 the Chicago Tribune\nVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",

Your property tax \u2014 or your rent, probably \u2014 is going up to help pay for better schools.\nNew tax bills are being mailed to 300,000 King County property owners on Feb. 14, and there could be some sticker shock: The average bill in King County is going up 17 percent.\n\u201cWe did some research and, frankly, this is the largest increase we\u2019ve seen on record for as long as anybody can remember, so certainly for decades,\u201d King County Assessor John Wilson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a new high water mark.\u201d\nThe percent increase varies city to city, from a low of 9.1 percent in Normandy Park to a high of 31.5 percent in Carnation. Seattle's tax hike matches the county average of 16.9 percent.\nMost of the tax hike results from a court ruling from six years ago. The state Supreme Court said Washington state was failing its constitutional mandate to fully fund public schools.\nOverall, about 57 percent of property tax collected in King County pays for schools, according to the assessor\u2019s office.\nWilson said some low-income seniors and veterans can get a break on their suddenly higher taxes.\n\u201cThe shame of it is, there\u2019s not a lot of tools available to county governments to provide direct property tax relief,\u201d Wilson said.\nHe said the state legislature is considering ways to let more low-income people get a break on their rising property taxes. Currently, veterans, people with disabilities and people at least 61 years of age can qualify for discounts on their property taxes if their household income is less than $40,000 a year.\nWhether you own or rent, you\u2019re likely to feel a pinch. Owners are free to pass the extra cost on to their tenants.\n\u201cThey always pass it on to the little guy,\u201d Washington Tenants Union interim executive director Violet Lavatai said.\nLandlords in Seattle are required to give tenants 60 days notice before raising their rent by 10 percent or more and 30 days notice for rent increases that are less than 10 percent.\nProperty tax increases for 2018 in King County.

I love that you were a pioneer in international development, that you were an organisation built on solidarity, education, empowerment \u2013 convincing British people that they could genuinely help people in other parts of the world.\nI love your recent campaign on inequality, choosing to pay attention to one of the world\u2019s most pressing and invasive issues. But sometimes, I hate what you\u2019ve become \u2013 a big corporate brand, competing for funds, dominating civil society voices and dictating the terms of engagement to others. I remember ringing you a few years ago when I was director of a small organisation to share our research on an issue we planned to campaign on, suggesting we collaborate. Your response? \u201cWe\u2019ll ring you if we need you.\u201d\nYou never did, in spite of the fact you ended up campaigning on the same issue, two years after we had started. This wasn\u2019t a one-off, either. I, and others, both north and south, had similar experiences on many occasions.\nQuick guide How dependent are UK NGOs on the government? Show Hide How dependent are UK NGOs on the government? Last year the UK government dedicated \u00a313.3bn to international aid, with a significant chunk spent through UK charities. But these millions of pounds of aid money are now at stake, following reports of sexual exploitation by Oxfam staff in Haiti. The government has threatened to cut funding to Oxfam unless the charity shows \u201cmoral leadership\u201d. In 2016-17, Oxfam\u2019s total income was \u00a3408.6m, according to its annual report, which includes \u00a331.7m from the UK Department for International Development (DfID). In addition to money from governments, international organisations and foundations, Oxfam generated \u00a390m last year through its shop and trading network. Around \u00a31.2bn of UK aid is spent annually through NGOs. In 2016, Save the Children secured multi-year contracts worth \u00a391m with the UK government. It describes itself as one of DfID\u2019s \u201ckey civil society partners\u201d, which implements around 60 UK government-funded projects in countries such as South Sudan, Somalia and Yemen. In the same year, the British Red Cross received \u00a316.3m in DfID funding. Around one fifth of Christian Aid\u2019s income came from the department, which provided \u00a320.1m in the year 2016-17. Christian Aid reported in its 2016-17 annual report that donations had dropped 13%, which it said was due to \u201cfewer high-profile humanitarian crises\u201d. Some have voiced concerns that as NGOs have become more reliant on government funding, they have also become less willing to criticise its policies. Charities are also nervous that the UK\u2019s aid budget, even before the Haiti sexual misconduct scandal, has been under increasing scrutiny. Last year, the UK was one of only six countries to spend 0.7% of gross national income on aid, a target set by the UN decades ago. Penny Mordaunt, secretary of state for international development, has said the UK remains committed to this target, despite some conservative MPs calling for it to be dropped. In a recent interview with the Telegraph, she said Britain will cut foreign aid spending to wealthier developing countries if they fail to \u201ctake responsibility\u201d.\nI have no doubts about the sincerity of many who work for and with Oxfam, or that they\u2019re stunned, that they wish it hadn\u2019t happened, that they want to do better. The majority of people work in this sector because they believe they can make a difference, however small. Oxfam and the sector do some great work. But arrogance and power have got in the way and could now seek to undermine its mission.\nThe Haiti scandal is not only big for Oxfam \u2013 it has implications far beyond, amplifying the vilification of the aid sector, which has repercussions for the UK charity sector as a whole.\n#MeToo strikes aid sector as sexual exploitation allegations proliferate Read more\nTwenty years ago, I was involved in a project to set up an international ombudsman for humanitarian assistance, of which Oxfam was a collaborator. In the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide, humanitarians were genuinely concerned that sometimes they caused more harm than good. They wanted to do better.\nAn institution was set up, which ultimately became a voluntary standard for the humanitarian sector to sign up to \u2013 an important step, and one that includes standards of behaviour, including a system to prevent sexual exploitation. But did it go far enough? Organisations don\u2019t seem much different now than they were then.\nWhat Oxfam and the wider sector have failed to do is to genuinely address their own power in international development. This is the systemic failing at play, not the sexual misconduct on its own.\nDecisions and actions by the larger agencies often continue to be based on arrogance and a \u201cwe know what\u2019s best\u201d approach, rather than something that is accountable to those most in need and the communities in which they\u2019re working. So it\u2019s no surprise that their response to the Haiti situation was wanting. They tried to hold on to the power and control of the issue and were caught out.\nSo how should Oxfam, and the international development sector respond? Could this #MeToo moment actually be the genuine catalyst for change that should have happened years ago?\nThe starting point is in responding to the crisis not as a one-off situation that could have been better handled, not as reputation control and damage limitation. But by opening up, listening to critics and putting the power into the hands of those in the global south \u2013 social justice movements, civil society groups, marginalised activists. A group of actors in philanthropy, as it happens, is doing just that, through the #shiftthepower movement.\nThis won\u2019t be easy \u2013 once an organisation falls from the perch, trust is difficult to reclaim. And in this case, trust in the UK international development sector is already eroding. If Oxfam rises to the challenge, however, its actions could actually serve to restore faith in the sector, and indeed wider civil society, over time.",

Our coverage of Iran has been outstanding, and we have virtually no official access. What we have are sources,\u201d the memo said. \u201cGet out into the country and learn more about how people live, what they think, what helps and hurts them, and how the government and its actions appear to them, not to us.\u201d\nThe letter encouraged reporters to \u201cnever be intimidated\u201d by the administration.\n\u201cDon\u2019t vent publicly about what might be understandable day-to-day frustration. In countless other countries, we keep our own counsel so we can do our reporting without being suspected of personal animus. We need to do that in the U.S., too,\u201d the message to reporters said. \u201cDon\u2019t take too dark a view of the reporting environment: It\u2019s an opportunity for us to practice the skills we\u2019ve learned in much tougher places around the world and to lead by example \u2013 and therefore to provide the freshest, most useful, and most illuminating information and insight of any news organization anywhere.\u201d\n(h/t: Ian Millhiser)",

        "text": "Order Reprint of this Story\nOctober 22, 2017 07:00 AM\nMake no mistake: Backers of a new single terminal for Kansas City International Airport aren\u2019t pitching the idea because KCI is a security risk.\nInstead, their aim is to keep Kansas City\u2019s momentum going by building a sparkling new entry point for the hundreds of thousands of people who fly into our town each year.\nA few years ago, in fact, the regional head of the Transportation Security Administration was blunt about the impact that a new terminal would have on security, saying it would have little effect .\nWith its three horseshoes, KCI has some advantages over a single terminal if someone were to go on a shooting rampage like the 2013 attack at Los Angeles International Airport, the TSA\u2019s Della Jacono said.\nSIGN UP\nThe two distinct terminals at KCI have a circular design. That suggests that fewer people might be hurt than in a large open space.\n\u201cDoes our layout add some security?\u201d Jacono asked. \u201cI think, yes, it does.\u201d\nBut there\u2019s also little doubt that a 1970s-era airport is hardly an ideal fit in a post-9/11 America. It was just a few years ago that KCI was called a key hub for terrorist travel .\nThe list of KCI\u2019s security shortcomings includes the lack of floor-to-ceiling walls to divide boarding passengers from those milling around the concourse. (More than once, airport officials have seen a family member toss a set of keys over that wall to a passenger waiting to board). Extending the walls to the ceiling is problematic because of heating and cooling concerns.\nAnother issue: the inability to set up bollards along the sidewalk to stop a car from crashing into the concourse. The problem: The sidewalk is too narrow to accommodate them.\nStill another worry: The skinny horseshoes are just 72 feet wide from the curbside wall to the big windows overlooking planes.\n\u201cCertainly if there\u2019s an active shooter coming through there, that\u2019s a pretty short distance...to get into the ticketed passenger area where the most people are,\u201d said Kevin Foley, executive director of the Des Moines International Airport.\nA new single terminal would remedy those concerns, and it also would provide more room for modern security screening devices, which are growing ever larger as technology improves.\nIn fact, new automated security lanes installed last month at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport aimed at accelerating the screening process are about one-third larger than machines they replaced. This latest iteration in screening devices allows passengers to move at their own pace as they remove shoes and belts and not delay faster-moving passengers.\nBringing such technology to KCI would likely require the elimination of seating or restrooms, given the narrow confines of the horseshoes.\nThe TSA also complains about its inability to take full advantage of its pre-screened passenger program at KCI due to \u201cfacility constraints.\u201d\n\u201cThis lack of access to trusted traveler programs...may affect the viability of (KCI) as a world-class aviation facility,\u201d James Spriggs, Missouri\u2019s federal security director, wrote last year.\nAirports conceived 30 or 40 years ago \u201cjust weren\u2019t designed for the requirements of today,\u201d said Andrew Thomas, a partner with Grimshaw Architects, a major international airport design firm. KCI had barely opened when the government demanded that airports implement new security to crack down on hijackers.\nSome fear that a single terminal would quickly translate into longer wait times for passenger screening because the number of checkpoints would be reduced to just one or two. But new airports are set up to handle large numbers with a centralized hub of screening devices and TSA agents. In some cases, wait times have actually improved. Experts say that the X-factor isn\u2019t airport design, but the number of screeners the TSA employs at at given hour.\nThe TSA seems to have managed the situation well. In 2016, KCI ranked among the lowest of all airports in the number of security delays \u2014defined as wait times of more than 20 minutes \u2014 between 2006 and 2015. Maintaining that record should be a priority if Kansas City moves ahead with a new airport terminal.\nThere\u2019s no doubt a yes vote on Nov. 7 for a new single terminal would be a step forward when it comes to addressing the increasingly complex security dynamic facing airports worldwide.",

        "text": "A 36-year-old southern Oregon woman underwent a double mastectomy and a hysterectomy based on genetic tests that medical professionals mistakenly said showed she carried cancer-causing genes, she claims in a $1.8 million lawsuit.\nElisha Cooke-Moore\u2019s lawsuit says that she had the radical, life-altering surgeries only after her gynecologist, Dr. William Fitts, determined that genetic blood tests indicated she had a 50 percent chance of getting breast cancer and up to an 80 percent chance of getting uterine cancer. The suit states her nurse practitioner, Lori Johns, also misread the test results and recommended a mastectomy.\nCooke-Moore\u2019s lawsuit says Fitts erroneously told her she had the MLH1 gene mutation and Lynch syndrome -- which indicate an increased risk of colorectal, uterine, ovarian and other cancers. But she later discovered after the surgeries that her test results indicated no such thing, according to the suit and her attorney.\n\u201cQuite frankly, we are stumped to why they would make this mistake,\u201d said Cooke-Moore's attorney, Christopher Cauble.\nThe lawsuit was filed last Thursday in Curry County Circuit Court.\nFitts\u2019 and Johns' attorneys didn't return requests Monday from The Oregonian/OregonLive for comment.\nThe lawsuit also lists Curry Medical Practice and Curry Medical Center as defendants. A spokeswoman declined to comment, and referred questions to Virginia Razo, chief executive officer of the Curry Health Network, which encompasses the medical practice and center. Razo didn't return a message seeking comment.\nIn addition, the lawsuit lists surgeon Jessica Carlson based on claims that she should have reviewed the test results and picked up on the other medical professionals' alleged error. Carlson couldn't be reached for comment through her attorney.\nCooke-Moore is a mother of five with children between ages of 9 and 18. She manages a laundromat with her husband in Gold Beach. She said she's on the Oregon Health Plan and asked her doctor about getting screened for cancer genes given that her grandmother and mother both had cancers.\nCooke-Moore told The Oregonian/OregonLive that she didn\u2019t learn her medical providers had made a mistake until she was reading through her medical file and happened across the test results.\nBut by then, she\u2019d already undergone a hysterectomy in August 2016 by Fitts and a double mastectomy in October 2016 by Carlson. She said she called the lab to verify she was reading the results correctly, then was floored.\n\u201cIt\u2019s terrible, I can\u2019t even find the words to tell you,\u201d Cooke-Moore said. \u201cAs a woman, they took what God gave me. I don\u2019t even feel like I am one at times.\u201d\nA hysterectomy puts women, such as Cooke-Moore, into forced menopause. It also prompts patients to receive hormone therapy.\nCooke-Moore\u2019s lawsuit also claims Carlson, the surgeon, botched the mastectomy and placement of implants. Cooke-Moore said she\u2019s had to have more than 10 corrective surgeries over the course of months, she\u2019s disfigured and she\u2019s still in pain every day.\n\u201cAlmost every week, every seven to 10 days, I was in there for surgeries,\u201d Cooke-Moore said.\nShe said her counselor has diagnosed her with post traumatic stress disorder.\nCooke-Moore shared a photo of her bare chest with The Oregonian/OregonLive, as it looks today, because she said she doesn't want anyone else to go through the same thing.\n\u201cSometimes I don\u2019t believe this is real,\u201d Cooke-Moore said. \u201cHow could this happen to me?\u201d\nThe lawsuit doesn\u2019t explain why doctors would remove her breasts based on the diagnosis of a MLH1 gene mutation and Lynch syndrome. But Cooke-Moore said Fitts also erroneously told her she had the BRCA1 gene mutation, which is known to indicate a higher risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Cooke-Moore said test results show does not have the BRACA1 gene mutation.\nGenetic screenings for future cancer risks and the ability to detect a faulty BRCA1 gene became widely talked about in popular culture in 2013 after actress Angelina Jolie announced that she had been diagnosed with the gene mutation and underwent a preventive double mastectomy. In 2015, she announced that she\u2019d followed up with another preventive surgery by removing her Fallopian tubes and ovaries.\nCaulbe, Cooke-Moore's lawyer, said Oregon tort claim caps limit how much his client can receive for her damages.

        "text": "Nelson Garcia/NBC 9/Twitter\nOn Saturday, Republican Rep. Mike Coffman held an event for his constituents at a public library in Aurora, Colorado. At least 150 constituents showed up, most of them hoping to ask Coffman about his recent vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act and his plans for a replacement. But only about 70 people got to meet with Coffman: Despite booking a large room with ample space, Coffman allowed in only four constituents at once for five minutes at a time. When the crowd grew restless, police put up crime scene tape and Coffman snuck out the back door\u2014six minutes before the event was scheduled to end.\nMark Joseph Stern Mark Joseph Stern is a writer for Slate. He covers the law and LGBTQ issues.\nCoffman co-authored a Denver Post op-ed on Friday urging the full and immediate repeal of the ACA. About 419,000 Coloradans have gained health care coverage since the enactment of the law, and many of them stand to lose their insurance if it is repealed. Yet Coffman has not proposed a clear replacement for the law, an issue constituents hoped to ask him about on Saturday. \u201cI am potentially going to lose my health insurance,\u201d Berthie Ruoff told NBC 9 while she waited to meet with her representative. \u201cI've had a preexisting condition. I've had breast cancer. What's going to happen to me? My spouse who had health insurance passed away. What do I do? You know, what am I supposed to do?\u201d\nAdvertisement\nBut neither Ruoff nor many other constituents who stand to lose coverage had an opportunity meet with Coffman. When it grew clear that Coffman would refuse to meet with a majority of those at the event, the crowd channeled its agitation into patriotic songs:\nCrowd starts singing while trying to get in to see Congressman Mike Coffman in Aurora. He only agreed with people a couple at a time. #9News pic.twitter.com/bqZgj4FF6f \u2014 Nelson Garcia (@9NewsEducation) January 14, 2017\nThis show of unity, however, did not impress Coffman. Indeed, it appears to have scared him: Rather than address the crowd, Coffman had police officers secretly escort him out of the back door before the event was set to conclude.\nWhile more than 100 people were waiting to meet with him, Mike Coffman sneaks out early from his own community event. #9News pic.twitter.com/NAZlXTKgQm \u2014 Nelson Garcia (@9NewsEducation) January 14, 2017\nA few people noticed Coffman sneaking out and attempted to address him. \u201cNext time,\u201d one woman pleaded, \u201cplease be sure you hear all your constituents!\u201d Coffman ignored them, hopped into a waiting car, and drove away. \u201cHave a good afternoon!\u201d yelled another exasperated woman.\nIn a statement released to NBC 9, Coffman insisted that \u201cwe only reserved the room at the Aurora Central Library for 90 minutes, which is usually plenty of time to see everyone,\u201d and apologized to \u201cthose who were unable to see the congressman today.\u201d While many in the crowd seemed to be under the impression that the event would be a town hall-style meeting, the statement claimed that that wasn\u2019t the intended format:\nRep. Mike Coffman routinely hosts constituent one on one meetings across the district. Constituents are invited to meet individually with the congressman to express their opinions, seek help with a range of issues, and discuss legislation.

        "text": "The Scottish Government was accused of presiding over a \u201cdecade of failure\u201d after a global study revealed Scotland has slipped down the \u00adinternational rankings in reading, maths and science.\nOpposition parties said ministers should be \u201cashamed\u201d of Scotland\u2019s education record after the nation\u2019s worst ever performance in a prestigious testing system used to evaluate the academic attainment of youngsters across the world.\nThe research conducted by the 2015 Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) looked at half a million 15-year-olds in OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries.\nPublished yesterday, the 2015 Pisa research identified a decline in key subjects which the SNP\u2019s opponents described as a \u201cshocking indictment\u201d of the Scottish Government\u2019s treatment of the education portfolio.\nIn a Holyrood statement, education secretary John Swinney admitted the results were \u201cunacceptable\u201d and vowed to turn round Scotland\u2019s schools.\nAccording to the Pisa results, Scotland was outperformed by 12 countries in science including England, Australia, Estonia, Finland and \u00adSlovenia.\nIn maths, Estonia, Finland and \u00adSlovenia again scored above Scotland, as did Norway, Belgium, the Republic of Ireland and Poland.\nThere were also 13 countries with higher scores in reading, including Estonia, Poland and Slovenia, as well as Ireland, Finland and Norway.\nThe results also showed a decline in the levels achieved in Scottish classrooms when compared with performance in previous years.\nIn the Pisa study of 2012, Scotland had been ranked above the OECD average for reading and science and average for maths. The most recent figures put Scotland at \u201caverage\u201d in all three subjects.\nHaving ranked as the highest in the UK for reading and maths, Scotland now lags behind England and Northern Ireland for both subjects.\nThe OECD research surveyed about 540,000 students worldwide in 2015 and uses a points system to rank 72 countries against each other, also looking at countries such as Scotland which are part of larger states.\nAgainst its own 2012 ratings, Scotland fell 13 points in reading, seven points in maths and 16 points in science.\nFor reading, Scotland scored 493 points, seven lower than England and four lower than Northern Ireland.\nScotland was just two points behind both countries for maths, at 491, while in science Scotland slipped further behind England with 497 points compared to 512.\nWhen viewed over a longer period, Scotland\u2019s OECD rank went from sixth in 2000 to 23rd in 2015 in reading. In mathematics Scotland has gone from ninth in 2003 to 24th in 2015 and in science Scotland is now 19th, compared to tenth in 2006.\nAccording to yesterday\u2019s statistics, Wales was the worst-performing UK country across all three subjects, the survey found.\nScottish Conservative shadow education secretary Liz Smith said: \u201cThese shocking statistics are a damning indictment of a decade of failure under the SNP.\n\u201cIn 2000, Scotland was performing well above the OECD average in all three Pisa measurements but in the intervening years we have slipped progressively backwards.\n\u201cThe fact that the SNP has been so obsessed with independence has meant that it has taken its eye completely off the ball when it comes to education.\n\u201cNicola Sturgeon says she wants to be judged by her performance on education but parents will rightly wonder what on earth her Scottish Government has been doing for the last ten years.\u201d\nLabour education spokesperson Iain Gray said: \u201cSNP ministers should be ashamed of these results. For all their warm words about making education a priority we are seeing performance going backwards as Scotland drops down international league tables.\n\u201cThese are terrible results after ten years of SNP government. They must wake up to the fact that their year-on-year cuts to school budgets, teachers numbers and support staff are damaging the life chances of Scotland\u2019s children.\u201d\nMr Swinney said he had spoken to his council of international education advisers about results, which he described as \u201cunacceptable\u201d.\nIn a statement to Holyrood on the Pisa results, he said: \u201cWhile they show that Scotland\u2019s scores are similar to the OECD average in all three areas tested, they also show that compared to 2012 our performance in reading has fallen.\n\u201cIn science and maths we are now below the levels at which we performed in 2006 and more countries have outperformed Scotland in all three areas than at any time since Pisa began.\n\u201cThe results show that closing the poverty-related attainment gap is a complex challenge which is not unique to Scotland.\n\u201cThe welcome improvements in performance in young people from deprived backgrounds, which we saw in the previous results between 2009 and 2012, have been maintained.\n\u201cHowever, there is still a gap between pupils from the least and the most disadvantaged background, around three years\u2019 worth of schooling, according to the OECD.\u201d\nHe continued: \u201cWe now must be clear: reform is required. This data reinforces the case for radical change that this government is determined to pursue. All of those comments I put on the record to sum up the government\u2019s response to what are statistics and \u00adperformance that is unacceptable.\u201d",

        "text": "One of the benefits of cloud computing is increased efficiency; services are rapidly deployed and ready for use in a matter of minutes versus the weeks or months it traditionally takes. But there is more to cloud computing than just getting your compute resources, storage capacity or application as a service within minutes. Based on personal experience with cloud consumers, here are the top five business benefits beyond efficiency.\nBusiness agility\nGetting the compute resources you need when you need them tends to shorten IT projects resulting in less FTE to deliver the project and a quicker and more predictive time-to-market. Being able to deliver results faster, cheaper and with more quality might just give your business a competitive edge and make her more nimble on her feet. I have seen a data analytics project being reduced from 4 months to just 3 weeks, reducing the projects time-to-market and overall cost significantly.\nNew business models\nIt has become much easier to start business innovation initiatives, often enabled by readily available cloud services. Utilizing or combining these services can result in new and innovative business models, generating new value propositions and resulting in new revenue streams. There are even companies that are building entirely new business models and value propositions solely using cloud services. I see this last category especially in small and medium enterprises, but also think of Spotify, and BitCasa.\nLess operational issues\nUtilizing standardized services can significantly reduce issues and defects. This increases business continuity and reduce time spent on operational issues, focusing more on the things that matter. Cloud computing allows you to deploy the same service or topology of services repetitively, with the same result every time. This allows organizations to predicatively deploy pre-build server images, application services or entire application landscapes defined using design patterns.\nBetter use of resources\nOn the other side of the \u201cbusiness agility\u201d model, more efficient projects and less operational issues allow your employees to spend their time on other more useful activities that may offer a greater potential value to your business. This benefit is different for every organization and harder to quantify, but people are an organizations biggest asset and this allows you to better utilize this asset.\nAnother take on better resource usage is based on the fact the principle of \u201ceconomies of scale\u201d; cloud service providers, in general, more efficiently utilize physical resources and reduce energy consumption in contract to a traditional IT approach.\nLess capital expense.\nThere is some debateabout the value of shifting from a capital expense (CapEx) model to an operational expense (OpEx) model. Overall sentiment is that, specifically for short and midterm projects, the OpEx model is more attractive because there are no long term financial commitments. In the OpEx model zero upfront investment is required, which allows organizations to start projects faster but also end them without losing any investments in the cloud services.\nAs you see, there is much more to cloud computing than technology alone. The true power of cloud is what the technology, implementing rapidly deployed services in the cloud, can mean for your business.\nEdwin Schouten is the Cloud Services Leader for IBM Global Technology Services in the Benelux region (Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg). He has 14 years experience in IT, of which the last 8 years in IT Architecture. He is Open Group Certified IT Architect, Expert level IBM IT Architect and has a Masters of Science degree in IT Architecture. He is an evangelist for cloud computing, both internal and external of IBM and active participant in cloud computing standardization organizations in the Benelux.",

But Washington\u2019s local marching bands are staying away.\nNone of the region\u2019s public school marching bands has applied for consideration to perform at Trump\u2019s ceremony next month. The past five presidential inaugurations have included at least one D.C. student marching band.\n\u201cI think everybody knows why and no one wants to say and lose their job,\u201d Howard University band director John Newson told NBC\u2019s Washington affiliate station WRC-TV. He said Howard\u2019s \u201cShowtime\u201d marching band, which performed at Barack Obama\u2019s first inauguration in 2009, did not apply for the inaugural parade because of budgetary constraints and a shortage of members.\nBut Newson also said the political beliefs of many band leaders and school administrators could be influencing their decisions not to take part in the ceremony.\nLast month, more than 2,000 D.C. middle school and high school students staged a mass walk-out to protest Trump\u2019s presidential election, leaving their classrooms in the middle of the school day to rally in front of Trump International Hotel.\nOfficials organizing inauguration festivities extended the deadline for bands to apply to participate, but it didn\u2019t make any difference with the D.C.-area performers.\nIn addition to the marching bands in Washington that didn\u2019t apply, no bands from Prince George\u2019s County in Maryland or Arlington County in Virginia put their names in for a chance to perform. A spokesman for Fairfax County public schools was also not aware of any bands that applied, according to WRC-TV.\nSo far, the only musician confirmed for Trump\u2019s inauguration is Jackie Evancho, a 16-year-old classical singer who was the runner-up on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\u201d in 2010.",

        "text": "A murder in Arkansas may change the way people behave around smart devices. A warrant has been issued for an Amazon Echo, revealing that Amazon may retain recordings on a server for law enforcement investigations.\nUPDATE, READ MORE: Amazon denies police Echo data sought in murder case warrant\nAn Amazon Echo was cited in a warrant related to a November 2015 murder in Bentonville, Arkansas. While other smart devices were identified, police have pinned some specific hopes on the Echo for a simple reason: it never stops listening.\nThe Echo is only activated after a user says its wake, or activation, word. But once triggered, it records snippets of things said that are then sent to an Amazon cloud. A speech-recognition network moves things along until a response is sent back to the device, where it obeys a user\u2019s commands.\nEcho owners may be familiar with the companion app, which stores all requests to be listened to and cherished. But that\u2019s not the only thing it does with those recordings. Amazon holds on to that data allegedly with the purpose of improving its voice assistant services, according to CNET.\nThe Echo in question belonged to James Andrew Bates, who is facing a first-degree murder charge for allegedly strangling and drowning Victor Collins in Bates\u2019 hot tub.\nAmazon twice refused the requests from Bentonville law enforcement. In a statement to Engadget, Amazon said: \"Amazon will not release customer information without a valid and binding legal demand properly served on us. Amazon objects to overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands as a matter of course.\u201d\nHowever, it provided investigators with Bates\u2019 account details, including purchases. In addition, investigators were allegedly able to recover information from the speakers but did not specify what type.\nIt is likely that authorities are hoping that Echo\u2019s eavesdropping technology accidentally led to it being activated by music, conversation, or ambient noises and created a recording containing any information relevant to Collins\u2019 death.\nThe warrant did not only cover Bates\u2019 Echo. His home was furnished with an array of smart devices that use Internet of Things technology such as a Nest thermostat, a Honeywell alarm system, wireless weather monitoring in the backyard and WeMo devices for lighting.\nGet a warrant: Federal judge throws out evidence obtained through Stingray #surveillancehttps://t.co/2cc2lsDsNXpic.twitter.com/lwZMO804EW \u2014 RT America (@RT_America) July 13, 2016\nIn fact, police seem to have already relied on his smart meter that measures electricity and water usage. Police found that on the night of the murder, Bates used roughly 140 gallons of water between 1:00am and 3:00am. Investigators believe that this could be a sign that he had used water to wash away evidence of what happened on his hot tub patio, Engadget reported.\nRegardless of what\u2019s discovered on the Echo, the use of evidence gathered from smart devices has been controversial. Kimberly Weber, Bates\u2019 attorney, told Engadget: \u201cYou have an expectation of privacy in your home, and I have a big problem that law enforcement can use the technology that advances our quality of life against us.\u201d\nThis wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone\u2019s digital footprint has been held against them in a court of law. Prosecutors in the infamous 2011 Casey Anthony trial tried to connect her Google searches for words like \u201cchloroform,\u201d \u201cchest trauma\u201d and \u201cneck breaking\u201d to the murder of her two-year-old daughter.\nAlso in 2011, the confession a 16-year-old Canadian boy made in a World of Warcraft chat of the murder of another teenager was used against him, along with text messages made allegedly where the body was dumped.",

        "text": "Breech's Week 15 picks\nLos Angeles will finish the season with John Fassel, the special teams coordinator who was named interim coach, and if the first 13 games are any indication, things will likely get better before they get worse. We say that with the full understanding that, for all of this team's issues during Fisher's tenure, they were inexplicably dominant against the Seahawks . Somehow, through all the mediocrity (the Rams are coming off 7-9 and 6-10 seasons), those Fisher-coached teams had an uncanny knack for beating the Seahawks, who are 30-14-1 in that same span. Specifically, the Rams have won four of the last five meetings, including the aforementioned Week 2 matchup.\nWe expect that to change.\nRecent Rams-Seahawks history aside, Thursday night should be a confidence-booster for the Seahawks fresh off a demoralizing 38-10 loss to the Packers at Lambeau Field.\n\"I'm really confident we'll bounce back,\" linebacker Bobby Wagner said Tuesday, via the team's website . \"We're not going to have another game like that. It was a just a crazy series of events. I can't see us doing that twice in one week. We're hungry, we're ready to get back out there, and it's going to show.\"\n\"That's not typical us,\" wideout Doug Baldwin added. \"For instance, we had a lot of balls we dropped as receivers, we don't do that. Five interceptions, we don't do that. It's easier for us to get past because we know that's not normal.\"\nAlso not normal: a Seahawks defense that is without Earl Thomas . The all-world safety, a 2010 first-round pick, missed his first NFL start in Week 12. Then, a week later, he was lost for the season after breaking his leg. And now this defense must figure out how to function in a post-Thomas world.\nIt's impossible to oversell just how integral he is to the Seahawks' defensive philosophy. But there's also a guy by the name of Russell Wilson who can go a long way to mitigate any other concerns about this team.\nIf he plays like he did in 2015, when he ranked third in total value and value per play among all quarterbacks, according to Football Outsiders , he can put this team on his back, even with Thomas sidelined. If, instead, Wilson stumbles through the next month or so in much the same way he played earlier this season (when, admittedly, he was hobbled by an ankle injury) -- or, God forbid, Sunday in Green Bay -- the Seahawks won't have a chance in January.\nWe're betting on the former.\nHow to watch\nWhat: Los Angeles Rams vs. Seattle Seahawks\nWhen: Thursday, Dec. 15, 8:25 p.m. ET\nWhere: CenturyLink Field",

        "text": "World\nThe Fighter: How Leila de Lima Ended Up Leading the Opposition to Rodrigo Duterte's Drug War\nPhilippine Senator Leila de Lima, center, gestures along with Catholic faithful, as they offer prayers during a mass for all the victims of the Philippine drug war, at a church in Manila on Nov. 23, 2016\nTed Aljibe\u2014AFP/Getty Images\nBy Nash Jenkins / Manila\nDecember 15, 2016\nIt\u2019s Christmastime in the Philippines. As is the case with most former Spanish colonies, the country is thoroughly Catholic, and celebrates the holiday with an endearing earnestness. Green and red lights have hung along the boulevards of Manila since late September. Above the front doors of the headquarters of the city\u2019s police force, a string of off-white light has been twisted to spell the words \u201cPeace on Earth.\u201d Traffic is even worse than usual, particularly on the highway that connects Ninoy Aquino International Airport with the city: many of the 10 million Filipinos forced to find work overseas \u2014 as maids, as waitresses, as fitness instructors \u2014 have come home for the holidays.\nIn the headquarters of the Senate of the Philippines, lawmakers have made a show of decorating the doorways to their offices. The building itself is squat and brutalist, and the low ceilings and fluorescent lights of its hallways give off an unfortunate bureaucratic feel, but the decorations at least bring some color. They\u2019re mostly orthodox \u2014 ropes of garland; wreaths ensconcing nativity scenes \u2014 except for one threshold, which has instead been bordered with off-white tinsel and elegant gold baubles.\nThis is the office of Senator Leila de Lima, and on the afternoon of Dec. 7, she is inside at her desk, exhausted but mostly unfazed. She is 57, with a neatly short haircut and a good taste in silk scarves. She wants you to know that this is a country at war. It\u2019s hard to see it, because this is a war that happens only at night. Since President Rodrigo Duterte was elected in May, nearly 6,000 people have died in what has been called his \u201c war on drugs ,\u201d an extrajudicial and largely arbitrary campaign to utterly expunge the Philippines\u2019 addicts and dealers. The toll is now on par with that inflicted last year by Boko Haram in Nigeria.\n\u201cThese are death squads,\u201d de Lima says simply, referring to the vigilantes that gun down suspected drug users in the streets, or sometimes in their homes.\nOutside of de Lima\u2019s private office there is a bullpen-type operation where her staff \u2014 made up of young, enthusiastic types \u2014 buzzes about, but in here it\u2019s quiet and sparse. She has her own nativity scene set up on a far table; on her desk, beneath the seal of the Philippine Senate, documents concerning the Senate\u2019s own inquisition into her alleged corruption have been meticulously stacked. She pays them no mind.\nDe Lima, who previously served as the Philippines\u2019 Secretary of Justice and chaired the country\u2019s Commission on Human Rights, was elected to the Senate in May, on the same day that the 71-year-old Duterte won in a near landslide. Since taking office in June, she has committed herself to standing up to him and fighting the war on drugs in the country\u2019s highest corridors of power. She is practically the only Philippine politician that does so.\nFriends and family carry the coffin of Jerico Camitan in a public cemetery on Nov. 13, 2016, in the Philippine city of Caloocan. Camitan, 21, and his partner Erica Fernandez, 17, were killed by two gunmen. A placard saying that they were drug pushers was placed near their bodies, although a drug test during autopsy cleared them of any drug use. Police said that they are not on any drug watch-list.\nJes Aznar\u2014Getty Images\nHers has been a grisly, largely futile battle. Duterte , who made his political name as the foul-mouthed mayor who cleaned up the southern city of Davao \u2014 once the country\u2019s murder capital \u2014 is wildly popular in the Philippines. (At last polling, his approval rating stood at 76%.) Global historians will remember this decade as the epoch that gave political legitimacy to contrarianism: Duterte, like Donald Trump in the U.S., appealed to voters because he was a walking refutation of an establishment they were disillusioned with, promising to restore order to the streets and luster to the national image.\nHis popularity extends to the country\u2019s legislature, where a rabid coalition of lawmakers has set out to impede de Lima\u2019s pursuit of justice and tarnish her image in the process. In September, she was ousted as the chairwoman of the Senate\u2019s Justice and Human Rights Committee, which, under her, had been tenaciously investigating the drug war\u2019s extrajudicial killings. Weeks earlier, Duterte himself publicly accused de Lima of covertly benefiting from a drug operation inside a Manila prison, and of having a sordid love affair with her driver, whom Duterte said had acted as her accomplice. He also crowed that he had a sex tape of the two of them that made him \u201close his appetite.\u201d On Aug. 29, before a rally of his supporters, he encouraged de Lima to \u201chang herself.\u201d\n\u201cAll of this \u2014 the slut shaming, the threats \u2014 it\u2019s unprecedented. No one has ever been subjected to this by a sitting President,\u201d de Lima says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s all fabricated. They\u2019re doing it to discredit me, to embarrass me, to humiliate me, to vilify me \u2014 really portray me as an immoral, bad woman so that people will not listen to me anymore.\u201d\nExcept that people are listening, for better or for worse. In a country with a capacious media diet and an insatiable appetite for scandal, she is now one of the most notable and polarizing players in the drug war. A search for her name on Facebook on Dec. 13 revealed that nearly 100,000 different users were talking about her at that moment. She had just arrived in Washington, where Foreign Policy was celebrating her as one of the year\u2019s top \u201cGlobal Thinkers,\u201d for \u201cstanding up to an extremist leader.\u201d The same day, back home, Duterte\u2019s allies in Congress had filed a criminal complaint against her for \u201cdisrespecting\u201d the legislature.\n\u201cDelima and other oligarchs who want DUTERTE ousted we are watching you,\u201d one Facebook user wrote. \u201cYou will not succeed whatever your EVIL plans are.\u201d\nMore to lose\nShe will tell you that she never wanted this for herself. She\u2019s talking about politics, and its attendant theatrics. But this is a country where the unlikeliest figures end up in positions of authority \u2014 Manny Pacquiao, the 37-year-old Filipino boxer who lost to Floyd Mayweather in a heavily watched fight in 2015, was the Senator who worked to remove de Lima from the drug-war investigation \u2014 so in any event she\u2019s in good company.\n\u201cMy father\u2019s advice was to avoid joining politics if I could,\u201d she says. \u201cHe said that my personality wasn\u2019t suited for it \u2014 that I might just get hurt, because I don\u2019t know how to play games.\u201d\nShe idolized her father Vicente, a prominent lawyer who went on to lead the Philippines\u2019 federal election-regulation commission. She was born in Iriga, a small city about 10 hours by car south of Manila, in August 1957. Like most of its neighbors in Southeast Asia, the Philippines was, at the time, a young country, fresh from the yoke of colonialism and vulnerable to flux. De Lima had just turned 8 when Ferdinand Marcos, a populist Senator and self-described war hero, was elected President in 1965, beginning a 20-year kleptocratic dictatorship that saw the imprisonment of tens of thousands of \u201cdissidents,\u201d the theft of up to $10 billion from the national coffers \u2014 a loss from which the impoverished nation has yet to recover \u2014 and the emergence of a national habit of extrajudicial killings. (Duterte has repeatedly praised Marcos and last month had him buried in Manila\u2019s Heroes\u2019 Cemetery .)\nDe Lima wasn\u2019t particularly political in her youth, but she was an exemplary student, largely because her father (a \u201cstrict disciplinarian,\u201d she says) would buy sets of encyclopedias and force her to pore over them. When she wasn\u2019t in school, she tagged along with her father to court and worked as \u201csort of his unofficial clerk\u201d at his office. By adolescence she was reading Supreme Court judgments for fun.\n\u201cI was bound to be a lawyer,\u201d she says. \u201cI had no other ambition in life, even as a child.\u201d\nShe graduated from a local Catholic high school (as valedictorian, she\u2019ll remind you), then the nationally prestigious De La Salle University in Manila, and went to law school at San Beda College, where Duterte had been a student just over a decade prior. (He happily claims to have shot a fellow student while he was there.) De Lima\u2019s professors remember her as an aggressive, fiercely bright student. At San Beda, she fell in love and married a classmate, Plaridel Bohol.\nPeople power: a large crowd outside Camp Crame in Manila on Feb. 24, 1986, cheers at a radio announcement that President Ferdinand Marcos has fled the country\nSadayuki Mikami\u2014AP\nThis was the early 1980s. The country was on the precipice of seismic change. In 1983, two summers before De Lima graduated from San Beda, the prominent opposition leader Benigno \u201cNinoy\u201d Aquino Jr. had been assassinated while disembarking from a commercial flight at Manila International Airport, triggering waves of political unrest and economic instability. Perhaps aptly, the biggest song in Manila those days was \u201cMore to Lose\u201d by an otherwise unknown British New Wave duo called Seona Dancing, whose singer, the then 23-year-old Ricky Gervais, would go onto create and star in The Office.\nDe Lima was waiting for her bar exam results when the Marcos regime finally fell in February 1986. The People Power Revolution, as it was called, was peaceful \u2014 under U.S. pressure, Marcos went into exile following a democratic election \u2014 and instilled young Filipinos like de Lima with optimism for a liberal future. Corazon \u201cCory\u201d Aquino , Benigno Aquino\u2019s widow, became President and renamed Manila\u2019s airport for her husband. De Lima got her bar-exam results back; she received the eighth-highest score in all of the Philippines.\nShe went to work for a prominent Supreme Court Justice, Isagani A. Cruz, but left in the early 1990s to pursue election law at the behest of several mentors. It was a relatively young practice \u2014 dictatorships tend to present few opportunities for election litigation \u2014 and thus small; de Lima was one of its only women.\n\u201cShe was very, very good,\u201d says Sixto Brillantes, who taught de Lima at San Beda and later practiced with her. \u201cWe were the elders in the practice, then she came in and made it difficult for us, because she spent all her time studying and researching the law \u2014 and taking all the clients!\u201d\nOver the course of a decade and a half, she took on a number of high-profile cases and clients, including several who have now deemed it politically expedient to attack her amid the ongoing smear campaign. She did this until May 2008, when she was contacted by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, who asked her to chair the country\u2019s Commission on Human Rights.\n\u201cIt was quite an unexpected turn of events, and never part of my career path,\u201d de Lima says. \u201cI thought I would be an election lawyer for life. I wasn\u2019t sure why [Arroyo] did it, but I took it as a challenge.\u201d\nThe month before her appointment, Philip Alston, a human-rights official at the U.N., published a scathing 65-page report on the country\u2019s apparent epidemic of extrajudicial killings. It mostly concerned the murder of activists, but one page was devoted to the southern city of Davao, describing \u201cthe shocking predictability with which criminals, gang members, and street children are extrajudicially executed\u201d there.\n\u201cThe mayor is an authoritarian populist who has held office, aside from a brief stint as a Congressman, since 1988,\u201d the report read. \u201cWhen we spoke, he insisted that he controls the army and the police, saying, \u2018The buck stops here.\u2019\u201d\nThat mayor\u2019s name was Rodrigo Duterte. De Lima had never heard of him, but quickly did her research. \u201cHe was a colorful figure \u2014 who was sort of different,\u201d she says, a conscious understatement. During his tenure as mayor of Davao , Duterte had enforced his anticrime agenda in ways that bordered on pathological: he admits to personally killing suspected criminals ; beating them; even threatening to strip speeding motorists naked and parade them through town. Davao\u2019s tourism board called it \u201cthe most peaceful city in Southeast Asia.\u201d\nThe reports of extrajudicial killings troubled de Lima, so she assembled a commission of five and spent several months traveling to and from Davao, about an 80-minute flight from Manila. They held public inquiry sessions in hotel function rooms where they questioned witnesses. At one, they subpoenaed Duterte himself.\n\u201cI chastised him publicly during that session, and he was rather meek,\u201d de Lima says. \u201cHe did not react violently. He was just looking at me. I was the one raising my voice at him in front of those people.\u201d\n\u201cHe has not forgotten that,\u201d she says. \u201cHe has not forgiven me.\u201d\nLeila de Lima, right, as a freshly appointed Justice Secretary, chairs a hearing on Sept. 3, 2010, into the Manila hostage crisis that saw eight Hong Kong tourists killed\nAFP/Getty Images\nIn 2010, de Lima\u2019s tenacity earned the attention of President-elect Benigno \u201cNoynoy\u201d Aquino III , the son of Ninoy and Cory, who invited her to his house and offered her the position of Secretary of Justice on the spot. It was a job that kept her busy: within two months of her taking office, a group of Hong Kong tourists in Manila were taken hostage on their tour bus by a disgruntled ex-cop, and eight of them were killed .\nMany of the cases were sensitive, and Aquino asked de Lima if she had security detail. She had first enlisted Ronnie Dayan as her driver and bodyguard in 2007, when she was in private practice. At that point, she says, her marriage to Bohol had been over for six years. She found herself in Dayan\u2019s company more often than not, and within months, she says, \u201cthings jut happened.\u201d\n\u201cI just fell for him,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI trusted him. I loved him. Love is love.\u201d\nHe ended up staying with her at her home in Manila during the workweek, which permitted discretion. The relationship, which would come back to haunt her, lasted seven years until 2014, at which point she broke it off, because he was \u201cbecoming rather big-headed. I just ran out of love.\u201d\nMeanwhile, President Aquino was encouraging her to run in the 2016 Senate elections. \u201cI figured I could best advocate for my core issues \u2014 human rights and justice \u2014 through legislation,\u201d she says. She was narrowly elected in May, but national attention was turned to a bigger contest \u2014 the presidential election, which in terms of discourse was being monopolized by Rodrigo Duterte.\nDuterte ran on his reputation as a vigilante mayor, pledging to kill \u201c100,000 criminals\u201d if he won. Crowds ate it up . The Western press wrung its hands over his crass comments about Pope Francis (whom Duterte called \u201ca son of a whore\u201d) and sexual violence (\u201cI should have been first [to rape her],\u201d he said of an Australian missionary, Jacqueline Hamill, who was gang-raped and killed during a 1989 prison riot in Davao), but voters didn\u2019t care. The Philippines, they felt, was at its nadir. The country\u2019s homicide rate was the highest in Asia in 2013; the trade and consumption of methamphetamine \u2014 shabu, in local parlance \u2014 was booming. As a result, the tourism industry, which employs 1 in 10 Filipinos and makes up 7.8% of the national gross domestic product, was suffering. Duterte, they believed, was going to fix this.\n\u2018Leila is also a fighter. She always has been\u2019\nDuterte took office at the end of June; the killings began promptly. According to some estimates, 1,400 people were killed in the first three months. Prisons were past capacity; inmates literally slept on top of each other. De Lima knew this was coming. She took office on the same day as Duterte, and 13 days later she introduced a Senate resolution demanding an inquiry into the brutality. \u201cExtrajudicial or summary killing is homicide,\u201d she wrote plainly. \u201cIf left unabated and unchecked, [it] can escalate into a crime against humanity under international law.\u201d\nDuterte was quick to go on the defensive, and so were his many supporters, both on the streets and in Congress. On Aug. 17, the President came forward with a damning accusation: during her tenure as Justice Secretary, de Lima had allowed the drug trade at the New Bilibud Prison, a maximum-security facility in metropolitan Manila, to flourish in exchange for campaign donations. He also brought up Dayan.\n\u201cHer driver,\u201d Duterte said, \u201cwas her lover. He was the one who was also collecting the [illegal] money for her during the campaign.\u201d\n\u201cLove Affair Led to Corruption,\u201d crowed one headline in the pro-Duterte Manila Times. In the comments section of the online article, one reader wrote, \u201cDuterte, you are a breath of fresh air, in an otherwise stinking world of authority and corruption.\u201d\nRonnie Dayan, former aide and former lover of Senator Leila de Lima, takes an oath during a congressional committee hearing on the drug trade, inside the National Penitentiary, at the House of the Representatives in Manila on Nov. 24, 2016\nCzar Dance\u2014Reuters\n\u201cThis is a total lie,\u201d de Lima tells me. \u201cLightning can strike me right now if that is at all true. Not in any capacity was I a coddler, a protector, a beneficiary of the drug trade.\u201d\nLess than a month later, de Lima was ousted in the Senate as the chairperson of the committee investigating the drug war. Senator Alan Peter Cayetano, who hails from an established political family and is widely seen as nebbish and opportunistic, stood up in the chamber and damned de Lima for \u201cmisleading\u201d the international media. Cayetano had been Duterte\u2019s running mate in the presidential election \u2014 in the Philippines, President and Vice President are elected separately; Cayetano finished third \u2014 but before that, he had been a legal client of de Lima\u2019s when she was an election lawyer. He declined to be interviewed for this article.\nIn the months since, the Senate has devolved into a kangaroo court in its investigations into both the drug war and de Lima\u2019s prison scandal. Her phone number and address have been provided to the public. Dayan, her partner of seven years, has begun testifying against her, which she says is a conspiracy. He told lawmakers that he collected money for de Lima from a drug dealer named Kerwin Espinosa , and on Dec. 6, during a session of the Senate, de Lima confronted him.\n\u201cI forgive you,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are being used to destroy me and I will know in due time who they are.\u201d One week later, a group of Congressmen filed a criminal complaint against her, for \u201cdisrespecting\u201d the House of Representatives.\nBrillantes, the former election official who taught both de Lima and Duterte and remains close to them both, has attempted to forge a d\u00e9tente, to little avail. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to the President \u2014 he\u2019s not going to back down,\u201d he says. \u201cIt will be very difficult for Leila, because the President is very reckless.\u201d\nThen: \u201cBut Leila is also a fighter. She always has been.\u201d\nDe Lima now suspects the demise of her political career, or worse, could be imminent. \u201cThe idea of being locked in jail is not far-fetched, especially since the President himself has repeatedly said it,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve always been concerned about my safety, but it\u2019s being intensified \u2014 we feel we\u2019re being monitored.\u201d\nShe is somewhat philosophical about all of this. \u201cTo be honest, sometimes I think I shouldn\u2019t have run, because I would have been spared all this,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if I wasn\u2019t elected, who would be fighting the President?\u201d\nSPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT",

        "text": "PIEDRAS NEGRAS, Coahuila \u2014 The Mexican cartel known as Los Zetas has been stockpiling Soviet-era rocket propelled grenades, body armor, assault rifles, and ammunition in this border city.\nThe discovery was made after a special state police unit designed to clash head-on with cartels, gathered intelligence about a business being used to stockpile weapons, information provided to Breitbart Texas by Coahuila authorities revealed.\nFollowing their investigation and after receiving an anonymous tip about a truck with gunmen arriving at the business, investigators obtained a search warrant and had members of Fuerza Coahuila raid a local junkyard in the Buena Vista neighborhood of the city. Because of the high-risk operation, federal police officers and the military arrived to the house to provide backup.\nAuthorities were not able to locate the gunmen but found five, Soviet-era rocket-propelled grenades, a launcher, 15 tactical vests with bulletproof metal plates, assault rifles, various loaded ammunition magazines, 19 marijuana bundles, and an SUV without license plates.\nadvertisement\nAs Breitbart Texas has been reporting, the Cartel Del Noreste faction of the Los Zetas continues to be a dominant criminal organization in Coahuila. That faction of Los Zetas is currently fighting with another known as Los Zetas Vieja Escuela over control of lucrative drug trafficking routes in this state as well as Tamaulipas and Nuevo Le\u00f3n.\nThe raging war between the two factions has led to almost daily kidnappings, gun battles, beheadings, dismemberments, and other gory executions. Both factions have previously used RPGs not only in their fights, but also to threaten each other through various messages, Breitbart Texas reported.\nThe Los Zetas cartel is also the criminal organization that is responsible for the kidnapping, murder and incineration of more than 300 victims, including women and children from the rural communities of Allende and Cinco Manantiales. Between 2011 and 2013, when the murders took place, half of the victims were taken to the Piedras Negras state prison where gunmen used 55-gallon drums to incinerate the human remains. Others were incinerated at local ranches. The case continues to be largely ignored by U.S. mainstream media.\nEditor\u2019s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Le\u00f3n to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities. The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used. Breitbart Texas\u2019 Cartel Chronicles are published in both English and in their original Spanish. This article was written by \u201cJ.M. Martinez\u201d from Piedras Negras, Coahuila.",

He doesn't feel that the property company, Camelot Europe, is fulfilling its side of the bargain.\nMr Connor told Sky News: \"I wake up every morning and I have to wash in cold water because they've turned the hot water off.\n\"We have been harassed, we have had the lights taken out of the hallway. It has been horrible, but the reason we are taking it to court is so that a judge can decide whether we are living like tenants or legalised squatters that pay rent.\n\"We want recognition as tenants.\"\nImage: Bristol City council says the Broomfields site will soon be redeveloped for council housing\nThere are around 4,000 property guardians living in disused buildings up and down the country. The idea is that people pay below market rent, which in turn protects properties from damage and squatters.\nMany guardians say it helps them to save money so that they can get onto the property ladder, others use it as a place to stay following a divorce or separation.\nHowever, the legal action being taken in Bristol could put the whole system under threat.\nPeter Lloyd from Camelot Europe, which runs the Broomfield Nursing Home site, said the scheme had been running successfully for many years.\nImage: Some property guardians have complained of grim conditions\nHe told Sky News: \"If they win the legal challenge, it would put people at risk in the buildings, the guardians themselves and also our jobs. In fact, the whole business model is based around a license and it could be devastating for us.\"\nThere are around 40 companies like Camelot Europe that rent out rooms in empty properties that are often owned by local councils.\nThe property firms get to keep all of the profits, but insist the scheme saves councils hundreds of thousands of pounds every year, that would otherwise be spent on security.\nWhilst some believe that commercial companies are taking advantage of property guardians, others are more than happy with the current setup.\nImage: Tim Moore says the scheme is helping him get on the property ladder\nTim Moore, who lives in a former sheltered accommodation in Buckinghamshire, managed by Dot Dot Dot, said there was a real community spirit in his building and that guardians could decorate the rooms as they wished, to make them feel more homely.\nHe told Sky News he was using the scheme to get on the housing ladder and everyone living in his property was of a similar age.\nA decision is likely to be made in the Bristol case in the coming months.\nThe city council said the Broomfield site will soon be redeveloped for housing and insists if Camelot Europe has breached its conditions, action will be taken and its contract will be revoked.",

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 10, 2016\nHe\u2019s very adamant about this. Our sister site Variety reported on December 8 that Trump would be retaining his executive producer credit on the reality show he started with Mark Burnett (the Mark B in question) in 2004, even while president. As president of the United States, Trump would be involved with a show owned by NBC, which controls several news channels; he would also be paid a salary in the \u201clow five figures range.\u201d\nIt\u2019s really unclear what CNN report he\u2019s referring to in the tweets, unless he speaking about his own campaign manager and top advisor Kellyanne Conway\u2018s remarks.

Whether it\u2019s President Obama or President Donald Trump, the idea that these men are going to be all work and nothing else all the time is just unrealistic because it\u2019s never happened in our lifetimes.\u201d\nThe next season of Celebrity Apprentice, hosted by Arnold Schwarzenegger, will premiere on January 2, 2017, just days before the presidential inauguration.\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Trump is going to be involved in The Apprentice?

(Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)\nThe CIA has concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system, according to officials briefed on the matter.\nIntelligence agencies have identified individuals with connections to the Russian government who provided WikiLeaks with thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and others, including Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, according to U.S. officials.

(Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post)\n[FBI and CIA give differing accounts to lawmakers on Russia\u2019s motives in 2016 hacks]\nThe Obama administration has been debating for months how to respond to the alleged Russian intrusions, with White House officials concerned about escalating tensions with Moscow and being accused of trying to boost Clinton\u2019s campaign.\nIn September, during a secret briefing for congressional leaders, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) voiced doubts about the veracity of the intelligence, according to officials present.\nThe Trump transition team dismissed the findings in a short statement issued Friday evening. \u201cThese are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history. It\u2019s now time to move on and \u2018Make America Great Again,\u2019 \u201d the statement read.\nTrump has consistently dismissed the intelligence community\u2019s findings about Russian hacking.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe they interfered\u201d in the election, he told Time magazine this week.

Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\nThe CIA shared its latest assessment with key senators in a closed-door briefing on Capitol Hill last week, in which agency officials cited a growing body of intelligence from multiple sources. Agency briefers told the senators it was now \u201cquite clear\u201d that electing Trump was Russia\u2019s goal, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.\nThe CIA presentation to senators about Russia\u2019s intentions fell short of a formal U.S. assessment produced by all 17 intelligence agencies. A senior U.S. official said there were minor disagreements among intelligence officials about the agency\u2019s assessment, in part because some questions remain unanswered.\nFor example, intelligence agencies do not have specific intelligence showing officials in the Kremlin \u201cdirecting\u201d the identified individuals to pass the Democratic emails to WikiLeaks, a second senior U.S. official said. Those actors, according to the official, were \u201cone step\u201d removed from the Russian government, rather than government employees. Moscow has in the past used middlemen to participate in sensitive intelligence operations so it has plausible deniability.\nJulian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, has said in a television interview that the \u201cRussian government is not the source.\u201d\nThe White House and CIA officials declined to comment.\nOn Friday, the White House said President Obama had ordered a \u201cfull review\u201d of Russian hacking during the election campaign, as pressure from Congress has grown for greater public understanding of exactly what Moscow did to influence the electoral process.\n\u201cWe may have crossed into a new threshold, and it is incumbent upon us to take stock of that, to review, to conduct some after-action, to understand what has happened and to impart some lessons learned,\u201d Obama\u2019s counterterrorism and homeland security adviser, Lisa Monaco, told reporters at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor.\nObama wants the report before he leaves office Jan. 20, Monaco said. The review will be led by James Clapper, the outgoing director of national intelligence, officials said.\nDuring her remarks, Monaco didn\u2019t address the latest CIA assessment, which hasn\u2019t been previously disclosed.\nSeven Democratic senators last week asked Obama to declassify details about the intrusions and why officials believe that the Kremlin was behind the operation. Officials said Friday that the senators specifically were asking the White House to release portions of the CIA\u2019s presentation.\nThis week, top Democratic lawmakers in the House also sent a letter to Obama, asking for briefings on Russian interference in the election.\nU.S. intelligence agencies have been cautious for months in characterizing Russia\u2019s motivations, reflecting the United States\u2019 long-standing struggle to collect reliable intelligence on President Vladi\u00admir Putin and those closest to him.\nIn previous assessments, the CIA and other intelligence agencies told the White House and congressional leaders that they believed Moscow\u2019s aim was to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system. The assessments stopped short of saying the goal was to help elect Trump.\nOn Oct. 7, the intelligence community officially accused Moscow of seeking to interfere in the election through the hacking of \u201cpolitical organizations.\u201d Though the statement never specified which party, it was clear that officials were referring to cyber-intrusions into the computers of the DNC and other Democratic groups and individuals.\nSome key Republican lawmakers have continued to question the quality of evidence supporting Russian involvement.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be the first one to come out and point at Russia if there\u2019s clear evidence, but there is no clear evidence \u2014 even now,\u201d said Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a member of the Trump transition team. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of innuendo, lots of circumstantial evidence, that\u2019s it.\u201d\n[U.S. investigating potential covert Russian plan to disrupt elections]\nThough Russia has long conducted cyberspying on U.S. agencies, companies and organizations, this presidential campaign marks the first time Moscow has attempted through cyber-means to interfere in, if not actively influence, the outcome of an election, the officials said.\nThe reluctance of the Obama White House to respond to the alleged Russian intrusions before Election Day upset Democrats on the Hill as well as members of the Clinton campaign.\nWithin the administration, top officials from different agencies sparred over whether and how to respond. White House officials were concerned that covert retaliatory measures might risk an escalation in which Russia, with sophisticated cyber-capabilities, might have less to lose than the United States, with its vast and vulnerable digital infrastructure.\nThe White House\u2019s reluctance to take that risk left Washington weighing more-limited measures, including the \u201cnaming and shaming\u201d approach of publicly blaming Moscow.\nBy mid-September, White House officials had decided it was time to take that step, but they worried that doing so unilaterally and without bipartisan congressional backing just weeks before the election would make Obama vulnerable to charges that he was using intelligence for political purposes.\nInstead, officials devised a plan to seek bipartisan support from top lawmakers and set up a secret meeting with the Gang of 12 \u2014 a group that includes House and Senate leaders, as well as the chairmen and ranking members of both chambers\u2019 committees on intelligence and homeland security.\nObama dispatched Monaco, FBI Director James B. Comey and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to make the pitch for a \u201cshow of solidarity and bipartisan unity\u201d against Russian interference in the election, according to a senior administration official.\nSpecifically, the White House wanted congressional leaders to sign off on a bipartisan statement urging state and local officials to take federal help in protecting their voting-registration and balloting machines from Russian cyber-intrusions.\nThough U.S. intelligence agencies were skeptical that hackers would be able to manipulate the election results in a systematic way, the White House feared that Russia would attempt to do so, sowing doubt about the fundamental mechanisms of democracy and potentially forcing a more dangerous confrontation between Washington and Moscow.\n[Putin denies that Russia hacked the DNC but says it was for the public good]\nIn a secure room in the Capitol used for briefings involving classified information, administration officials broadly laid out the evidence U.S. spy agencies had collected, showing Russia\u2019s role in cyber-intrusions in at least two states and in hacking the emails of the Democratic organizations and individuals.\nAnd they made a case for a united, bipartisan front in response to what one official described as \u201cthe threat posed by unprecedented meddling by a foreign power in our election process.\u201d\nThe Democratic leaders in the room unanimously agreed on the need to take the threat seriously. Republicans, however, were divided, with at least two GOP lawmakers reluctant to accede to the White House requests.\nAccording to several officials, McConnell raised doubts about the underlying intelligence and made clear to the administration that he would consider any effort by the White House to challenge the Russians publicly an act of partisan politics.\nSome of the Republicans in the briefing also seemed opposed to the idea of going public with such explosive allegations in the final stages of an election, a move that they argued would only rattle public confidence and play into Moscow\u2019s hands.\nworld national-security Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas true endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address.

After the election, Trump chose McConnell\u2019s wife, Elaine Chao, as his nominee for transportation secretary.\nSome Clinton supporters saw the White House\u2019s reluctance to act without bipartisan support as further evidence of an excessive caution in facing adversaries.\n\u201cThe lack of an administration response on the Russian hacking cannot be attributed to Congress,\u201d said Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, who was at the September meeting. \u201cThe administration has all the tools it needs to respond. They have the ability to impose sanctions. They have the ability to take clandestine means. The administration has decided not to utilize them in a way that would deter the Russians, and I think that\u2019s a problem.\u201d\nPhilip Rucker contributed to this report.\nRead more:\nAs Democrats demand probe over CIA election claim, GOP senators express doubt\nKremlin defers to Trump on the CIA assessment that Moscow helped him win\nThe long history of the U.S. interfering with elections elsewhere",

The deal will allow Howard to avoid prison time unless he violates his probation, the Twin Falls Times-News reported.\nThe October 2015 assault drew national headlines after the victim told the court that he had been attacked by three football team-mates and sodomized with a coat hanger in the locker room.\nIdaho teenager sues school district over alleged locker-room rape Read more\nThe victim\u2019s family filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the high school and school officials, claiming that the school had failed to protect the student from a campaign of racial harassment by other students that culminated in the sexual assault.\nThe victim was called racial epithets such as \u201cwatermelon\u201d, \u201cchicken-eater\u201d, and \u201cnigger\u201d, and Howard taunted the victim with a \u201cKu Klux Klan\u201d song, the lawsuit alleged.\nBut during Friday\u2019s hearing, the prosecutor, deputy attorney general Casey Hemmer, played down both the racial and sexual aspects of the crime, according to the Twin Falls Times-News.\nHemmer told the judge that the crime was not a sex crime and that Howard should not be treated as a sex offender, the paper reported. He also stated that his office did not believe that the crime was racially motivated.\nR Keith Roark, one of the attorneys representing the victim in the civil case, said: \u201cThe plea agreement is an abomination, and the in-court comments of the prosecutor, if accurately reported, reflect a perverse compassion for the perpetrator of a sickening, violent act rather than a concern for the young man whose life has been turned upside down by group violence \u2013 which we believe was indeed, at least in part, racially motivated.\n\u201cHow this can be anything other than a sexual assault is beyond my comprehension, and I have been prosecuting and defending sex crimes for 40 years,\u201d Roark added.\nHow this can be anything other than a sexual assault is beyond my comprehension R\u200b\u200b Keith Roark\n\u201cDeputy Attorney General Hemmer\u2019s actions and statements dehumanizes the young man who was heinously penetrated and fuels and sanctions our culture of sexism, racism, able-ism, domination, aggression, and violence, and in turn, the Office of the Idaho Attorney General is complicit in state-sanctioned sexism, racism, able-ism and violence,\u201d the Idaho Coalition Against Sexual & Domestic Violence wrote on Facebook.\n\u201cNothing short of a complete retraction by the Attorney General of Hemmer\u2019s outrageous actions and statements and immediate action against Hemmer will be acceptable,\u201d the group added.\nA spokesman for the Idaho attorney general\u2019s office declined to comment on the plea or the prosecutor\u2019s statements, citing a gag order imposed by the judge until Howard is sentenced in February 2017.\nLee Schlender, another attorney representing the victim in the civil case, said the victim\u2019s parents were \u201coutraged\u201d by the plea bargain and the statements made by the prosecutor. Schlender said the parents of the victim had not been properly consulted about the plea bargain, and that the victim himself could not approve or disapprove of the deal because he was currently institutionalized.\n\u201cThe father said he wanted to see these fellas spend some time in prison for what they did,\u201d Schlender said, and referred to the proposed sentence of probation as a \u201cslap on the wrist\u201d.\n\u201cTo say that this has nothing to do with the fact that he\u2019s one of only one or two black children in the school, and he\u2019s mentally disabled, and he\u2019s the only one that had this happen to him \u2013 to say that this doesn\u2019t have to do with race is just incomprehensible,\u201d Schlender said.",

It is an actual question bouncing around the internet after an attack on a well-known far-right activist, Richard B. Spencer, in Washington after the inauguration of Donald J. Trump as president on Friday.\nMr. Spencer, who is credited with coining the term alt-right and describes himself as an \u201cidentitarian,\u201d was punched in the head on Inauguration Day by a person clad in black as he was being interviewed by a journalist. At the time of the attack, Mr. Spencer was explaining the meaning of Pepe the Frog, a cartoon figure adopted as a mascot by the alt-right, a racist, far-right fringe movement that is anti-immigrant, anti-Semitic and anti-feminist. Video of the attack shows Mr. Spencer reeling to one side under the force of the blow and his attacker darting through a crowd after landing the punch.\nThe Run-Up The podcast that makes sense of the most delirious stretch of the 2016 campaign.\nA bystander who chased the attacker later posted a video on YouTube of his encounter with the man. The assailant can be heard telling a friend that the man filming them is \u201cmad at me because I hit Richard Spencer.\u201d (The bystander who made the video does not appear to be a supporter of Mr. Spencer and disparagingly refers to the activist in the clip as \u201ca neo-Nazi.\u201d)\nVideo by HAarlem VEnison\nMr. Spencer described the incident in a Periscope video he posted on Twitter on Friday. Shortly after the attack, he said, he was spat on by another person. On Saturday, he said he had a black eye.\nMr. Spencer\u2019s video was recorded from what he described as \u201ca safe space.\u201d He said he thought the attack happened, in part, because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\u201cThere was an actual anti-fascist rally going on, and I walked into it,\u201d he said. Margarita Mikhaylova, a spokeswoman for the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department, said on Friday afternoon that Mr. Spencer had not filed a police report.\nVideo of the attack quickly inspired a flood of jokes and memes online, some of which set the punch to songs like \u201cBorn in the U.S.A.\u201d Jon Favreau, a former speechwriter for Barack Obama, was one of many who posted a comment.\nI don't care how many different songs you set Richard Spencer being punched to, I'll laugh at every one. \u2014 Jon Favreau (@jonfavs) January 21, 2017\nThere was little substantive debate online about the ethics of punching Mr. Spencer. Twitter is not a place where minds are often changed, and the supporters and opponents of the sucker punch were unmoved by one another\u2019s quips.\nOpponents of the punch tended to say that violence had no place in political debate.

        "text": "Anyone feeling morally superior to Americans should reflect on how Donald Trump feels about us. \u201cIn England, they have a system where you can actually sue if someone says something wrong,\u201d he purred . \u201cOur press is allowed to say whatever they want.\u201d\nYou can understand his envy. Despite reform, an English publisher still has to prove his or her innocence. More enticingly for the rich, money tilts the scales of justice. Unless you have a straightforward case, few lawyers will offer a \u201cno win, no fee\u201d deal. A wealthy media organisation can threaten you with a costs bill of \u00a31m or more if you lose. Equally, plutocrats can threaten increasingly impoverished newspapers with costs they cannot afford, if they don\u2019t back down and back off either.\nBusinessmen make dangerous politicians because they spend their careers expecting deference on pain of dismissal. Most people would restrict the freedom of others to criticise them if they had the power, even if the criticism were true \u2013 especially if it were true, I should add. But while we must grow thick skins, the holders of corporate power can act with megalomaniacal petulance.\nTrump\u2019s everyday behaviour shows corporate obsequiousness has bred in him a violent vanity. He never forgets or forgives a slight. Conservative pundits tell us to calm down and remember the left was as \u201chysterical\u201d when Ronald Reagan won in 1980 as it is now about Trump. They fail to see what the left of 1980 also failed to notice. Reagan was an optimistic leader, who wanted to end the cold war. Trump is dark and vindictive and it is impossible to be too pessimistic about his character.\nFrom All the President\u2019s Men to Spotlight, we are conditioned to think of America as a land of brave journalism and exceptional protections for press freedom. But if 2016 has taught us anything it is that \u201cAmerican exceptionalism\u201d is dead. Trump isn\u2019t exceptional. He is just the latest in a growing gang of elected strongmen who have gone on to attack constitutional restraints on their power in Turkey, Russia, Hungary, Poland and the Philippines.\nThe US constitution is meant to be exceptional because its first amendment states: \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.\u201d It\u2019s one of the Enlightenment\u2019s best-written restraints on power and, God knows, we could use it in the UK. But for most of America\u2019s history the courts operated with a repressive version of the libel law they inherited from the British empire. It was only in 1964 that the supreme court added the proviso that public figures have no right to sue unless the writer had deliberately lied about them, a bar too high for nearly everyone in public life to jump. Martin Luther King forced the judges to liberalise. His tactic of peaceful civil disobedience can work only if there is a free press to report the abuses the protesters are trying to remedy.\nWhen liberal newspapers reported on police violence against black demonstrators in the old south, however, all-white juries in Alabama hammered them with punitive damages. Herbert Wechsler, the New York Times lawyer, who had earned the right to be respected by trying Nazi war criminals at Nuremberg, constructed a brilliant argument. He showed the framers of the constitution had never intended giving police chiefs and other public figures the right to sue their critics. For all Wechsler\u2019s learning, it is beyond doubt that, when the supreme court agreed, it was issuing a political verdict in the broadest sense to protect the civil rights movement.\nAmerican lawyers believe Trump cannot overturn it. He will appoint one or two supreme court judges, they say, but existing conservatives in the nine-judge court have shown no interest in challenging free speech. They forget that the conservative movement is now Trump\u2019s movement and may be ready to respond to his priorities. After all, conservative judges may ask, why should public figures who have clearly been libelled be denied redress? Many rich men are already asking that question. They are taking advantage of a new balance of power where news organisations are everywhere getting poorer while the rich are everywhere getting richer. The Idaho plutocrat Frank L VanderSloot, for instance, may have lost his case against the leftwing magazine Mother Jones, but he had the satisfaction of tying up its editors in legal action for years. Meanwhile, the Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel circumvented the first amendment and closed the Gawker site he loathed for outing him as gay.\nThe American right can look to the deformed democracies of Hungary, Poland, Turkey, the Philippines and Russia for encouragement. Most strikingly, they can also look to Britain, where plutocratic censorship has the potential to go further than anywhere else in the west.\nInstead of cutting the costs of libel and privacy actions and opening the courts to all, Lord Justice Leveson responded to the hacking scandal by beginning a process where rich men can fund \u201cindependent\u201d press regulators. The Formula One tycoon Max Mosley obliged. (The British Peter Thiel hated the tabloids for invading his privacy by reporting on his meetings with prostitutes.) No free newspaper can submit to a state-backed regulator and none has agreed to co-operate. Labour and Liberal Democrat peers are as determined as Trump to bring journalists to heel, however, and are close to persuading the government to punish recalcitrant newspapers by making them pay the costs of libel cases, even if they win them.\n\u201cProgressive\u201d politicians and the allegedly liberal celebs in Hacked Off profess to be Trump\u2019s opponents. But they, too, find self-interested reasons to censor. The liberal-left hate the Mail and the Murdoch press for reasons I understand. They don\u2019t care that the Guardian and Private Eye, which exposed the hacking scandal, along with every other decent news organisation, won\u2019t submit to Mosley\u2019s regulation either. Their desire to punish their enemies overrides basic liberal principles. More importantly, they lack the political imagination to realise how their own betrayals of liberalism will be exploited.\nThink of it. The state can license a plutocrat to establish a regulator. Publishers who refuse to co-operate will face costs they can\u2019t afford to meet, even if what they write about a Russian oligarch, a New York property tycoon or a Turkish secret policeman is true. Wolfish strongmen all over the world will watch Britain\u2019s experiment with punishing journalists for reporting accurately with fascination. As Trump has shown, we are their inspiration and their justification.",

He helped lead national Catholic outreach for President Obama's 2012 re-election.\nPope Francis kisses a baby Jesus statue as he leads midnight Christmas Mass at the Vatican in 2014. (European Pressphoto Agency)\nLast week, Fox News\u2019s Bill O\u2019Reilly had good news for his viewers \u2014 the war on Christmas had finally ended. \u201cWe won!\u201d O\u2019Reilly declared.\nWhat were O\u2019Reilly\u2019s metrics for measuring this great victory over the secularists who he saw as so hell-bent on ruining Christianity\u2019s great feast? Simple: The number of stores using \u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d instead of \u201cHappy Holidays!\u201d has increased in the past decade.\nBut as O\u2019Reilly noted, there are still some companies out there who won\u2019t oblige with the victor\u2019s demands that Christmas greetings be done the right way. Don\u2019t worry, O\u2019Reilly assured his viewers, there\u2019s a new president in town, \u201cand that\u2019s bad news for them, because Donald Trump is on the case.\u201d\nIn one sense, O\u2019Reilly is absolutely right. The president-elect has made renewed Christian strength in the public sphere a key underpinning to his shocking victory. Trump told us time and again that when he\u2019s president, Christianity will have power again in the United States. \u201cChristians don\u2019t use their power,\u201d Trump has complained. \u201cWe have to strengthen. Because we are getting \u2014 if you look, it\u2019s death by a million cuts \u2014 we are getting less and less and less powerful in terms of a religion, and in terms of a force.\u201d\nIn typical Trump fashion, he thinks this starts in the marketplace: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you one thing: I get elected president, we\u2019re going to be saying \u2018Merry Christmas\u2019 [at department stores] again.\u201d He continued, \u201cBecause if I\u2019m there, you\u2019re going to have plenty of power. You don\u2019t need anybody else. You\u2019re going to have somebody representing you very, very well. Remember that.\u201d\nUnfortunately for O\u2019Reilly and Trump, there\u2019s still one person they must defeat in this self-perpetuating war on Christmas. It\u2019s Pope Francis, the 80-year-old leader of 1.2 billion Catholics across the globe.\n\u201cChristmas is a charade!\u201d Francis said last year.\nThese aren\u2019t exactly words you would expect from a Christian during the holiday season, much less the pope. But that\u2019s exactly what the troublemaker Pope Francis told a group of us gathered for Mass in 2015. \u201cChristmas is approaching: There will be lights, parties, lighted Christmas trees and manger scenes. \u2026 It\u2019s all a charade.\u201d\nWhy would the pope wage war on Christmas? \u201cThe world continues to go to war. The world has not chosen a peaceful path. There are wars today everywhere, and hate,\u201d Francis said. \u201cWe should ask for the grace to weep for this world, which does not recognize the path to peace. To weep for those who live for war and have the cynicism to deny it. God weeps; Jesus weeps.\u201d\nIn other words, the meaning of Christmas isn\u2019t strength and visibility in the public sphere. The central claim of this holiday has always been that the rejected, crucified and executed Jesus Christ is still somehow Lord of the entire earth. In Trump\u2019s world, those like Jesus Christ are the losers. In God\u2019s world, these are the victors.\nThe power of Christmas is derived from our ability to communicate and practice God\u2019s saving love in the invisible parts of the world. Saying \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d at Macy\u2019s might win an empty-shell public-relations battle, but it does nothing to truly advance the Gospel of Jesus. The Christmas that Donald Trump is defending is the Norman Rockwell Christmas: a bourgeois celebration that\u2019s accented by turkey, gifts and comfort. From a Christian standpoint, then, Pope Francis is right: This version of Christmas is a charade, and it\u2019s time to reignite the war against it.\nIf we shouldn\u2019t aim to elevate the domesticated, bourgeois notion of Christmas and signal a return to Christian cultural dominance, then what is Christmas really all about? In short, it\u2019s about the opposite of what Trump thinks it is: Reaching out to the excluded and downtrodden, and humbling ourselves before others.\nIn the time of Jesus\u2019 birth, the expectation of a messiah was strong among the Jewish people. They were looking for a hero who would at last set their people free from every form of moral, political and economic slavery they faced under the tyranny of Rome. The prophet Isaiah told them this liberator would \u201cbeat spears and swords into plowshares and pruning hooks\u201d and end the scandal of war.\nYet God didn\u2019t send a military leader or a politician to save his people, but a child born to an unwed mother, who even fled violence as a refugee. This child did indeed bring liberation, but not just for the people of that time and place. He was to be a savior for all of humanity and for every age, destroying death forever and restoring life through the means of a shameful death upon the cross. No one would have expected the messiah to be born in poverty, obscurity and exclusion, far from the cultural and political centers of the world \u2014 but such is God\u2019s logic.\nIn this framework, the last are first, the poor are blessed, enemies are loved and strangers are welcomed. Black lives matter here. LGBT lives matter here. And so, too, do the lives of women, refugees, the imprisoned, the unborn and anyone else who suffers exclusion.\nBut Jesus doesn\u2019t just come for the excluded. He comes, too, for the parts of our own lives that are suffering. In Jesus, Pope Francis says, God \u201cassumed our frailty, our suffering, our anxieties, our desires and our limitations. \u2026 He accepts our poverty, God who is in love with our smallness.\u201d\nIf Pope Francis is right, these are the sentiments that should highlight our Christmas celebrations this year. Francis argues that the Christmas story \u201casks us to risk a face-to-face encounter with others, with their physical presence which challenges us, with their pain and their pleas, with their joy which infects us in our close and continuous interaction. True faith in the incarnate Son of God is inseparable from self-giving, from membership in the community, from service, from reconciliation with others.\u201d\nAt Christmas, Jesus came all the way down into the grittiness of human dysfunction \u2014 its violence, its disloyalty and its sinfulness \u2014 to bring everyone up. The very essence of the holiday calls us out of our comfort and into discomfort.\nIn Jesus\u2019 birth and in his story, we can begin to understand Christmas for what it really is: God\u2019s invitation to a revolution of tenderness.",

        "text": "My wife Alice and I are not having our after-the-holidays party this year. It\u2019s a 20+ year tradition; a welcome respite for our friends following Christmas and Hanukah. Guests always say how much they appreciate a party after the holidays and having a chance to finally relax.\nThis year, however, I told my Alice that Trump voters were not welcome in my home. Living in Dallas, Texas, and given the conservative bent of our friends, that meant no party. We couldn\u2019t invite only the few people we knew who conformed to our sense of decency. We weren\u2019t even sure where some of our neighbors stood. So we cancelled the whole affair.\nIn fact, I went further. I told my tennis group, whom I had known for years, I would no longer be playing with them, since most were Trump supporters. I stated that I could not socialize with people who lacked a moral compass which I consider fundamental to being American.\nWhat has brought about such an extreme reaction in me, to the point of cutting off relationships and ceasing activities that I enjoy? It\u2019s really not that complicated.\nImmediately after the election, I was somewhat sanguine \u2013 despite the shock of \u201closing\u201d an election in which my candidate won the popular vote by almost 3 million. My mother reminded me that we had survived Reagan. My sister noted that our grandmother \u2013 a proud Suffragette \u2013 had once commented: \u201cwe survived Harding, Coolidge, Hoover, The Depression and World War II; we can survive anything.\u201d\nI thought perhaps that Trump the President, might be chastened by the awesome responsibility he was about to assume \u2013 and leave behind the toxicity of his campaign rhetoric. Then, in rapid succession, three things happened that changed my mind.\nFirst, Trump announced that Steve Bannon, of Breitbart infamy, would become a senior White House advisor. To invite such a purveyor of lies, hate and bigotry to work inside the hallowed gates of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue was beyond the pale.\nThen, my company\u2019s COO, a Chinese American, told me how his small children were distraught, and in tears that morning. Children in their elementary school had bullied them with comments such as: \u201cyour father is going to be killed because he didn\u2019t vote for Trump\u201d, and \u201cyou are going to be kicked out of the country\u201d. This in Coppell, Texas, a wealthy suburb. These remarks were directed at third generation American citizens, by small children, obviously channeling their parents.\nThe next day, another friend relayed the anti-Semitism that was unleashed at Highland Park High School, ranked in the top 1% of all Texas public high schools. His son had become subject to taunts such as: \u201cwhy don\u2019t you go to Auschwitz?\u201d and \u201ctake a shower, Jew boy\u201d. These were teenagers, but we know where those sentiments originated.\nThese incidents washed over me like a plague. I realized this was not a normal election, with one political philosophy prevailing over another. This was a repudiation of the value system \u2013 and Constitution - on which the United States is based. This was a green light to racism and demagoguery which apparently festers even in people of privilege. This was an overt turning of the cheek to freedom of the press, to truth, decency and respect. The bigotry that my friends\u2019 children experienced were not isolated incidents. Intimidation, threats and hatred \u2013 directed at minorities, immigrants, etc. - have come fast and furious since November 8th.\nEvery person who voted for Trump is complicit. Some, like Hillary\u2019s deplorables, are incorrigible. Others, like our comfortable friends, chose their own pocketbooks, or their understandable distaste of Hillary Clinton, over doing what was right.\nThese people should have known better. Any student of history can compare current times to the rise of fascism in the 1930\u2019s \u2013 when an electorate reeling from The Great Depression brought to power Hitler and emboldened Mussolini. The formula was eerily familiar: blame others for your own failures and turn power over to a man who pledges to restore the country to its prior greatness.\nToday, restless populations in the US and Europe are traumatized by economic and social changes brought about by globalization. Many blame immigrants, minorities, elites and the media for their plight. This is now a world in which strongman elected officials like Putin, Duterte, La Pen and Hofer are enjoying surges of popularity. They wantonly attack life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness \u2013 all in the name of economic retribution, law and order, and fighting terrorism.\nTo this menacing trend, we now add Donald Trump. This is not a joke. This is not tolerable. This is not American. The people who enabled it by voting for this ignorant and dangerous buffoon are not welcome in my home.",

        "text": "This recap contains spoilers for Riverdale Season 1, episode 1, titled \"The River's Edge.\"\n\"Our story is about a town, a small town, and the people who live in the town. From a distance, it presents itself like so many other small towns all over the world: safe, decent, innocent. Get closer though, and you start seeing the shadows underneath. The name of our town is Riverdale. And our story begins, I guess, with what the Blossom twins did this summer \u2026 \"\nRiverdale, The CW's live-action Archie comics drama, aims to subvert any and all assumptions you have about Archie Andrews (KJ Apa) and his friends from over 75 years of comic books.\nThis isn't your grandparents' Archie \u2013 this dark, scandalous tale, equal parts Twin Peaks and Gossip Girl, is a lot more like recent iterations of Archie comic book stories, rather than the rosy-cheeked, aw-shucks gang that first debuted in digests back in 1941.\nNarrating the whole saga for us in live-action is the moody, sardonic voice of Jughead Jones (Cole Sprouse), hardly seen in the series premiere but always heard as he tries to make sense of the town's biggest scandal.\nJust after dawn on the 4th of July, the Blossom twins, Jason (Trevor Stines) and Cheryl (Madelaine Petsch), went for a boat ride, and later that day Cheryl was found soaked and alone on the river's edge and Jason was gone. Cheryl's story was that their boat capsized and Jason never surfaced, so their parents buried an empty casket and his death was ruled an accident. His body was never found \u2026 until the first week of the new school year, opening up an official murder investigation where everyone is a potential suspect, even his twin sister \u2014 who creepily refers to her brother as her \"soul mate.\" Is Riverdale really going there with twin-cest and twin-tracide right out of the gate?\nBut we'll get to that later. First, let's meet the newest incarnations of the Archie gang and dig into all the secrets that the town of Riverdale is hiding.\nNew girl Veronica Lodge rolls into town fresh off her father's incarceration for fraud and embezzlement. Her mother Hermione (Marisol Nichols) claims their apartment is the only piece of property in her name and not her corrupt husband's, but after getting a duffel bag full of money anonymously delivered by their doorman Smithers (Tom McBeath), it's clear there is more going on than Veronica realizes.\nCamila Mendes as Veronica Lodge Image: Diyah Pera/THE CW\nThe most interesting thing to note about The CW's version of the bratty, elitist rich girl from the comics is that Mendes has been given the green light to fully humanize Veronica. Where she was once evil and manipulative in the comics, now she's empathetic.\nShe's not perfect, of course, and still makes some mistakes \u2013 mostly where her new crush \"Archiekins\" is concerned \u2013 but she's committed to becoming a better person after realizing that she was basically a spoiled, entitled rich bitch before father's arrest. She's using her move to Riverdale as a fresh start, an opportunity to become the best version of herself. Finally, Veronica is a relatable character.\nMeanwhile, classic girl-next-door Betty Cooper (Lili Reinhart) is hiding more than enough secrets of her own. Where Veronica is now a flawed hero in her own right \u2014 one who's even committed to helping Betty realize her full potential \u2014 Betty has enough baggage and emotional damage to employ a therapist full-time... but she would never admit to that.\nHer overbearing mother, already burdening her with the stress of college applications even though Betty is only a sophomore, pushes her into Adderall abuse, and the whole family is seemingly haunted by the mysterious events surrounding Betty's older sister, who's currently living in a group home after her relationship with Jason Blossom prompted a nervous breakdown of some kind, apparently \"ruining\" her.\nBut Betty desperately pushes all those issues down to maintain the perfect facade of \u2026 well, perfection. Helping distract her from all the cracks starting to show in her psyche is her crush on her BFF Archie, whom she hasn't seen all summer. Encouraged by her gay best friend (and the first openly gay character in the Archie universe) Kevin Keller (Casey Cott), Betty decides to finally tell Archie how she feels \u2026 especially since, in the wise words of Kevin, \"Archie got hot. He's got abs now!\"\nLili Reinhart as Betty Cooper Image: Katie Yu/The CW\nDid you really expect anything less from The CW's live-action Archie? Yes, working for his father Fred (Luke Perry) all summer in construction had worked wonders on the redheaded teen. Not only had he developed jaw-dropping muscle definition, the physical busywork gave him a lot of time alone with his thoughts, helping him realize how passionate he is about composing music.\nWhen he divulges his new secret to Betty, she practically turns into the heart-eyes emoji. Hot, sweet and gifted with a knack for catchy pop ballads? He's the total package. But right as she's pouring her heart out to her best-friend-turned-potential-soulmate, Veronica walks into Pop's Chock-lit Shoppe, and by the look on his face, it's clear that the classic Archie/Betty/Veronica love triangle is born.\nBut as has been repeatedly emphasized, this is not your classic Archie. He's also harboring quite a scandalous secret \u2014 more so than contemplating quitting football or telling his father that he wants to forgo inheriting his father's construction company for a career in music: he's been engaging in an illicit teacher/student relationship with the now young and hot Ms. Grundy (Sarah Habel) all summer long.\nNo one knows about their affair, but that all could change as Archie struggles with whether or not come forward about what he heard on the morning of the 4th of July. He and Ms. Grundy were getting in some, ahem, \"alone time\" at the river's edge when they both heard a gunshot.\nNot knowing back then that Jason Blossom would turn up dead, they tried to forget what they heard, knowing they couldn't come forward or else Grundy would get in major trouble \u2014 but with the discovery of Jason's body with a bullet hole in his forehead, there's no way Archie can keep quiet about the mysterious gunshot.\nGrundy does her best to convince Archie not to come forward, but this is Archie we're talking about \u2013 as girl-crazy and dumb as this iconic teenage boy can be, he's still a good person who always tries to do the right thing, especially with his father teaching him the value of honesty. There is an expiration date on both of their secrets, and the only question is when will it all get exposed?\nSEE ALSO: 9 shows to get excited about in 2017\nBetty and Veronica, oblivious to Archie's tawdry affair with Grundy, convince Archie to join them on a trio group friend date to the back-to-school semi-formal dance, and Betty finally does get to confess her feelings to Archie. He doesn't respond to her at first, and at Cheryl's after-party he's \"forced\" to spend seven minutes in heaven with Veronica.\nOf course, they can't deny their attraction: Archie and Veronica kiss, and he realizes he doesn't feel the same way about Betty that she does about him. He tries to let her down easy later that night, telling her that she is so perfect that he's not good enough for her, which, in typical boy fashion, he doesn't realize is the exact wrong thing to say. Betty's far from perfect, but she hides it so well from those closest to her, and now that's costing her the one thing she wants most: Archie.\nA shining beacon of light in the dark town is the empowered, confident and strong Josie McCoy (Ashleigh Murray) and her Pussycats. With record-ready voices and attitude to back up their talent, the Pussycats know they're bound for stardom despite being trapped in their small town.\nAshleigh Murray as Josie McCoy Image: Katie Yu/The CW\nWhen Archie approaches Josie with songs he wrote, hoping to learn from her musical expertise and hopefully to convince the Pussycats to perform them, she shuts him down immediately, letting him know they're all about building their brand and telling their own story with songs they write. And thus begins the iconic rivalry between Josie and Archie and their musical aspirations.\nOther noteworthy moments:\n- Jughead's narration is revealed at the very end of the premiere to be the basis of a novel about all the events of the summer, starting with Jason's death. Also interesting to note is that he and Archie are ex-best friends, which seems almost blasphemous to Archie fans but is extremely compelling to watch onscreen. Apparently, Archie did something to Jughead and never talked to him about it, ruining their relationship. Instead of letting him destroy another relationship, Jughead helps Archie realize in a tense conversation at Pop's that he needs to talk to Betty to save their friendship, lest they end up as strained as Archie and Jughead.\n- Hermione and Fred dated in high school. It's going to be pretty awkward when Veronica and Archie find out their parents got hot and heavy after the teens shared a steamy make out sesh.\n- Another steamy make out comes courtesy of Veronica helping Betty put Cheryl in her place during River Vixen cheerleading tryouts. Cheryl tries to shame Betty's goody-two-shoes exterior for lacking \"heat\" and \"sizzle,\" so Veronica ends her tirade by kissing Betty in front of the whole squad. Veronica helps both of them make the team, but as a downside, they now have to put up with Cheryl on a daily basis.\nMadelaine Petsch as Cheryl Blossom Image: Dean Buscher/The CW\nBut when Cheryl tries to goad Betty into finally letting her feelings out, all it does is cause Betty to ball her fists so hard she makes herself bleed before once again swallowing her anger and emotions to maintain that good girl image. The troubled teen is already at her breaking point, and it's clear she'll go to any lengths necessary to keep maintain her illusion of control.\n- Moose is gay! Well, closeted, but he definitely propositions Kevin in the bathroom for a little heavy petting that escalates into a late-night meet-up down at Sweetwater River. Unfortunately, their secret hookup comes to a screeching halt when they discover Jason Blossom's dead body floating at the water's edge, with a clear bullet hole in his forehead, marking the beginning of the series' big murder mystery.\n- Archie ends up making a deal with Grundy: he won't come forward about July 4th, essentially keeping her safe from anyone discovering their affair, but only if she helps mentor him with his music. She agrees, under the impression that they'll keep things strictly professional, but that's clearly not going to happen. At least for now, he can juggle music lessons before school, football practice after school and working for his dad on weekends, so it's not like he has to choose any particular path yet.\n- Jason's autopsy will be performed on Monday, and by Tuesday the first arrest will be made. The first, but certainly not the last.\nRiverdale airs Thursdays at 9 p.m. on The CW.",

Tintu Luka failed to qualify for the semifinals of the women\u2019s 800m race after finishing sixth in her heat race.\nA disastrous Olympic campaign where they made up just the numbers and a doping fiasco to add to the misery, Indian athletics yet again did little to shrug off the tag of country\u2019s most underachieving sport in the year gone by.\nThe only silver lining in an otherwise unfruitful year was the world junior record set by javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra, who became the first Indian to own a world record, though in the junior category.\nThat gave the embattled Athletics Federation of India the bragging rights that India also can produce world beaters in athletics.\nThe 18-year-old lad from Haryana hurled the spear to a stunning distance of 86.48m at the IAAF World Under-20 Championships in Bydgoszcz, Poland, nearly two meters beyond the earlier world Under-20 record of 84.69m which was in the name of Latvia\u2019s Zigismunds Sirmais.\nChopra, currently studying at DAV College in Chandigarh, also broke the existing national senior record of 82.23m which was in the name of Rajinder Singh.\nHis achievement was all the more stunning as his effort was better than that of Rio Olympics bronze-winner Keshorn Walcott (85.38m) of Trinidad and Tobago.\nChopra did not qualify for Olympics as his achievement came after the Olympics qualifying deadline of July 11 though he crossed the Rio entry standard of 83m.\nChopra also became the first Indian track and field athlete to win a gold in the World Championships. Legendary long jumper Anju Bobby George had won a bronze in the senior World Championships in 2003.\nA record 34 track and field athletes (out of India\u2019s total 117) took part in the Olympics \u2014 the grandest of the world stage \u2014 but in the end, except for Lalita Babar it turned out to be a mere presence.\nThe Rio performance was one of the worst in India\u2019s athletics history. In London 2012, two athletes \u2014 Vikas Gowda and Krishna Poonia \u2014 made it to the finals while two race walkers came up with national record timings.\nBut this time the performance was disappointing despite the Sports Ministry splashing crores of rupees on their training under the Target Olympic Podium Scheme.\nBabar qualified for the finals in the women\u2019s 3000m steeplechase, the first time by an Indian in track events after P T Usha did 32 years ago in 400m hurdles in 1984 Los Angeles. She finished a creditable 10th to be the only saving grace among her underperforming colleagues.\nThe build-up to the Games was not good either as it was rocked by dope flunks by two national record holders \u2014 shot putter Inderjeet Singh and 200m runner Dharambir Singh. Both were barred from taking part in the Olympics.\nDharambir was later banned for eight years last month as it was his second dope offence. The case for Inderjeet is still in the hearing stage before the Anti-Doping Disciplinary Panel of the NADA.\nOn the administrative front, Adille Sumariwalla was re-elected unopposed as the president of AFI for a second term at its Annual General Body Meeting. Sumariwalla, also a member of the powerful IAAF\u2019s ruling council, was the lone nomination received for the top post and he will serve as president till 2020.\nDespite being lightweights in the competitive arena, India continued to rule the roost as far as doping was concerned and the country was placed once again in the top three in a WADA report based on the information supplied by various national bodies.\nIndia had the third highest Anti-Doping Rule Violations (ADRVs) in 2014, with 96 cases, behind Russia (148) and Italy (123), according to a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report.\nIn that, athletics contributed most dope cheats with 29 cases, followed by powerlifitng (23) and weightlifting (22) as the trend of the last few years continued.\nThe year 2016 was also a sort of achievement for Odisha sprinter Dutee Chand who came out of IAAF ban following a \u2018gender test\u2019 to qualify for the Olympics though her campaign in Rio ended disappointingly as she finished seventh in her 100m heats with a below-par 11.69secs.\nThe 20-year-old became the first Indian female athlete to qualify for the 100m dash in Olympics in 36 years after legendary P T Usha competed in the blue-riband event in the 1980 Moscow Games.\nShe qualified for the Olympics with a national record time of 11.24 seconds at the 26th G Kosanov Memorial Meet in Almaty, Kazakhstan.\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2991951\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/08/o-p-jaisha-759.jpg%22 alt=\"Rio Olympics, rio olympics 2016, rio olympics Indian athletes, rio olympics P V sindhu, Rio Dipa Parrikar, Rio olympics Sakshi Malik, Rio Indian team, Rio Indian team medals, Rio O P jaisha\" width=\"759\" height=\"422\" />\nThe year began with the Indian track and field athletes enjoying expected supremacy in the South Asian Games (SAG) in Guwahati by winning 28 gold medals out of the country\u2019s 188. Veteran long distance runner Kavita Raut clinched gold in women\u2019s marathon and qualified for Olympics in the process.\nThen, the domestic season began with the athletes making frantic efforts to make the Rio Olympics ticket. Federation Cup, National Inter-State Championships and three Indian Grand Prix legs served as the domestic events while many athletes embarked on training-cum-competition tours outside the country to try and qualify for Rio.\nThe notable foreign exposure trip was the 38-member Indian track and field team for a 12-week training-cum-competition stint at the world class facility at Spala, Poland with dope tainted Yuri Ogorodinik among the support staff.\nSeveral national records were broken in the process and the country saw some remarkable performances in the build-up to the Olympics, which also raised doubts about how clean they were in achieving these Rio standards.\nIt was, however, a stark contrast at the Olympics where the pre-Games \u2018remarkable\u2019 performances could not be matched and very few athletes could even achieve their personal best.\nTopping the list of flops was none other than triple jumper Renjith Maheshwary who made it to his third Olympics after producing the season\u2019s third-best performance in the world at that time.\nThe Kerala jumper, who has flopped time and again on the world stage, touched down at 17.30m at the Indian Grand Prix in Bengaluru in July to qualify but crashed out in the first round in Rio managing just 16.13m.\nAnother big let down was discus thrower Vikas Gowda who travelled to Rio despite being on the recovery path from an injury. He ended his challenge with a best throw of 58.99m that was nearly six metres short of his best.\nGowda\u2019s female counterpart, discus thrower Seema Antil, finished a disappointing 20th in the qualifying round , and 20th overall, with a best throw of 57.58m, well below her personal best of 62.62 metres.\nLegendary P T Usha\u2019s prodigy Tintu Luka came a cropper on the global stage once again as she failed to qualify for the semifinals of the women\u2019s 800m race after finishing sixth in her heat race.\nThe 27-year-old Luka clocked a season\u2019s best of 2 minute 00.58 seconds to finish sixth in heat number 3 and 29th overall out of a total 65 runners. It raised questions on how long Luka will take to make a mark at the global stage under Usha.\nRated high after their 2012 London show, the race walkers also produced a disappointing show this time in Rio and Manish Singh was the best Indian at 13th among men in the 20km race walk while Khushbir Kaur finished at 54th among women.\nThe women\u2019s 4x400m relay quartet finished seventh in the heats while the men\u2019s team faced the embarrassment of being disqualified.\nO P Jaisha created an unnecessary controversy after returning home from the Olympics. Jaisha, who finished 89th and also fainted at the finish line, accused the Indian officials for not providing her water and drinks during her Marathon race despite designated stations being given for the country, a claim denied by AFI.\nHer coach and AFI said she did not ask for drinks \u2014 for which there will have to be permission a day prior to the race. A probe by Sports Ministry absolved the AFI from any inaction and blamed the athlete for the confusion.\nJaisha did not get the support of her coach Nikolai Snesarev who said that she herself had refused when asked by him if she would need personalised refreshment during the race.\nHe also said that Jaisha had never used personalised drinks during marathon competitions.\nSports Ministry set up a two-member inquiry committee to probe Jaisha\u2019s case but later ruled that there was no fault on the part of the athletics officials.\nTowards the end of the year, the capital city witnessed a top class Delhi Half Marathon race with Kenya\u2019s reigning Olympic champion Kipchoge winning the event.\nHe said he came to run in the half marathon well aware of the poor air quality of Delhi to inspire the young generation of the country to take up running.\nFor all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App",

        "text": "Final test results confirm an experimental Ebola vaccine is highly effective, a major milestone that could help prevent the spread of outbreaks like the one that killed thousands in West Africa.\nScientists have struggled to develop an Ebola vaccine over the years, and this is the first one proven to work. Efforts were ramped up after the infectious disease caused a major outbreak, beginning in 2013 in Guinea and spreading to Liberia and Sierra Leone. About 11,300 people died.\nThe World Health Organization, which acknowledged shortcomings in its response to the West Africa outbreak, led the study of the vaccine, which was developed by the Canadian government and is now licensed to the U.S.-based Merck & Co. Results were published Thursday.\nMerck is expected to seek regulatory approval in the U.S. and Europe sometime next year.\nThe experimental vaccine was given to about 5,800 people last year in Guinea, as the virus was waning. All had some contact with a new Ebola patient. They got the vaccine right away or three weeks later. After a 10-day waiting period, no Ebola cases developed in those immediately vaccinated, 23 cases turned up among those with delayed vaccination.\nThe Lancet paper published Thursday mostly crystallizes what was already largely known from interim results released last year. The vaccine proved so effective that the study was stopped midway so that everyone exposed to Ebola in Guinea could be immunized.\n\"I really believe that now we have a tool which would allow (us) to control a new outbreak of Ebola of the Zaire strain,\" said Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, a WHO assistant director-general who was the study's lead author. \"It's the first vaccine for which efficacy has been shown.\"\nShe noted that other Ebola vaccines are underdoing testing, and that a vaccine is also needed to protect against a second strain, Sudan.\nThe virus first turned up in Africa in 1976 and had caused periodic outbreaks mostly in central Africa, but never with results as deadly as the West Africa outbreak. Many previous vaccine attempts have failed. Among the hurdles: the sporadic nature of outbreaks and funding shortages.\nOnline:\nWHO: http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/en/",

        "text": "The country that coined the word \"karoshi,\" or death by overwork, wants companies to let workers finish early on the last Friday of every month, go out and have fun.\nIn an effort to curb excessive work hours and to spur consumption, the Japanese government and business groups are launching a \"Premium Friday\" campaign, scheduled to start on February 24.\nAlthough it's unknown how many companies will participate, the nation\u2019s biggest business lobby, Keidanren, wrote to its more than 1,300 member companies, encouraging them to take part.\nOne indication of just how tough it is to get change in Japan\u2019s rigid work practices: the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, which is pushing the idea, hasn\u2019t decided yet if its officials will get to join in. However, METI Minister Hiroshige Seko said \"I'm giving my secretaries a strict order not to put in any appointments after 3 p.m.\" on the first Premium Friday.\nThere\u2019s a clear relationship between leisure time, holidays and spending, said Toshihiro Nagahama, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute in Tokyo. If most workers, including those at small and medium-sized firms participate, private consumption could rise by about 124 billion yen ($1.6 billion) on each Premium Friday, according to his calculations.\nThat may provide some boost to private consumption, which is about 60 percent of the economy.\nHowever, Nagahama said he\u2019s concerned that workers at smaller companies may have difficulty leaving early, or that they\u2019ll simply have to make the time up on other days, limiting the campaign\u2019s impact.\nJapanese workers typically use just half of their annual paid leave entitlements. In part to work around this problem and enforce time away from work, Japan has 16 annual public holidays, more than countries including the U.S. and France.",

        "text": "\u201cOf course the U.S. has more missiles, submarines and aircraft carriers, but what we say is that we are stronger than any aggressor, and this is the case,\u201d Mr. Putin said toward the beginning of the news conference, which typically lasts four hours or more.\n\u201cAs for Donald Trump, there is nothing new about it, during his election campaign he said the U.S. needs to bolster its nuclear capabilities and its armed forces in general,\u201d he added.\nMr. Putin said that any new Russian nuclear weapons would stay within the limits of existing treaties. Although Moscow and Washington have taken to rattling sabers more than in the past, experts said that the architecture of previous nuclear arms treaties has so far held.\nIn 2007, Russia spent 2.7 percent of its gross domestic product on defense, Mr. Putin said, but the figure grew to 4.7 percent in 2016. Russia spent about $52 billion on its military in 2015.\nHe said that the proportion would gradually decline to 2.8 percent again by 2019. \u201cThis will not have an impact on our plan to increase our defense capabilities,\u201d he said.\nThe budget cuts are being forced by an extended recession, though Mr. Putin tried to put a positive spin on that, as well. He said the overall economy had contracted 3.7 percent in 2015 and probably a further 0.5 to 0.6 percent in 2016, but that some sectors were expanding, like agriculture, which grew 4 percent.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In retaliation, Russia has banned imports of many Western dairy and other agricultural products.\nSome analysts have suggested that the growth in agriculture was nothing exceptional.\nMr. Putin also noted other positive signs, including that inflation and capital outflows had slowed, but he said that there were still problems, including a drop in personal income for most Russians.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nOn the American election, Mr. Putin said the Democrats were trying to blame their defeat on external factors like Russia. He said his popularity among American Republicans was not personal, but a reflection of their worldview.\n\u201cIt means that a significant part of the American people have the same perception about how the world should be developing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is good that people support us in this, in terms of traditional values.\u201d He said it was a good basis for improving Russian-American relations.\nMr. Putin mocked recent statements by President Obama and others that former President Ronald Reagan would be turning in his grave over the support for Russia and for Mr. Putin among Republicans.\nIf anything, he said, it would be former presidents like Franklin D. Roosevelt who would be turning in their graves over the losses suffered by the Democratic Party.\nMr. Roosevelt united the country, Mr. Putin said, but \u201cthe current administration divides it.\u201d\nThe Obama administration has accused Russia of interfering in the American election, not least by hacking the computers at the Democratic National Committee and releasing emails embarrassing to Mrs. Clinton.\nAlthough Mr. Putin did not publicly endorse either candidate during the campaign, his administration made its preference for Mr. Trump clear. Among other reasons for disliking Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Putin has blamed her for the street demonstrations in Russia in 2011 and 2012 that greeted his return to the presidency, citing her endorsement of the protests while she was secretary of state to accuse her of fostering them.\nAsked directly about statements by Mr. Obama that he had warned Mr. Putin to stop hacking in the United States, Mr. Putin said that he would not reveal the contents of a private conversation.\nBut he repeated statements by Mr. Trump that anyone could have done the hacking, including someone in the United States sitting on his couch. And Mr. Putin repeated his usual response to questions about the hacking, saying the main point was the contents of the emails and the light they shed on the Democrats\u2019 activities and plans.",

(Manuel Balce Ceneta/Associated Press)\nThis post has been updated.\nVisitors to the newly revamped White House website get more than a simple rundown of first lady Melania Trump\u2019s charitable works and interests \u2014 they also get a list of her magazine cover appearances and details on her jewelry line at QVC.\nHer biography starts with traditional details, such as her date of birth in her native country of Slovenia and information about her background as a model. That\u2019s when the brief backgrounder takes a promotional turn. The website includes a lengthy list of brands that hired her as a model and several of the magazines in which she appeared, including the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue.\nIt is not uncommon for the White House to note the accomplishments of the first lady in her official biography, but Trump\u2019s decision to include a detailed list of her media appearances and branded retail goods is unusual.\n[BREAKING] President Trump now stands in violation of the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause. https://t.co/RfdWbUQ1xB \u2014 Citizens for Ethics (@CREWcrew) January 20, 2017\nThe site also touches on the previously controversial subject of Melania Trump\u2019s university background.\n\u201cShe would pursue a degree at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, but pause her studies to advance her modeling career in Milan and Paris before moving to New York in 1996,\u201d the site reads.\nMelania Trump\u2019s college education was a sensitive point during the campaign.

        "text": "Imagine a computing platform that would have no single point of failure and would be resilient to the cyberattacks that are making the headlines these days. This is the promise behind blockchain, the distributed ledger that underlies cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum and challenges the traditional server/client paradigm.\nIn 2009, Bitcoin became the first real application of blockchain, a secure decentralized monetary exchange platform that removed the need for central brokers. More recently, blockchain has proven its worth in other fields.\nBlockchain is the culmination of decades of research and breakthroughs in cryptography and security, and it offers a totally different approach to storing information and performing functions, which makes it especially suitable for environments with high security requirements and mutually unknown actors.\nThe concept is already being used in several innovative ways to enhance cybersecurity and protect organizations and applications against cyberattacks.\nOne of the main characteristics of the blockchain is its immutability. The use of sequential hashing and cryptography, combined with the decentralized structure, make it virtually impossible for any party to unilaterally alter data on the ledger.\nThis can be used by organizations handling sensitive information to maintain the integrity of data, and to prevent and detect any form of tampering.\nGuardtime is a data security startup that is placing its bets on blockchain technology to secure sensitive records. It has already used blockchains to create a Keyless Signature Infrastructure (KSI), a replacement for the more traditional Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), which uses asymmetric encryption and a cache of public keys maintained by a centralized Certificate Authority (CA).\nMatthew Johnson, CTO at Guardtime, believes that while PKI was a suitable technology for digitally signing software, firmware and network configurations, it was never designed to authenticate data.\n\u201cThe fundamental threat with PKI is that you need to base your security on the secrets (keys) and the people who manage them,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cThat is very hard to do well and impossible to prove \u2014 just as in the real world you can\u2018t prove a secret has been kept, in the security world you can\u2018t prove a key has not been compromised.\u201d\nBlockchain-based security is predicated on distributing the evidence among many parties.\nIn contrast, instead of relying on secrets, blockchain-based security is predicated on distributing the evidence among many parties, which makes it impossible to manipulate data without being detected.\n\u201cBlockchain has eliminated the need for trusted parties to verify the integrity of data just as in the cryptocurrency example it eliminated the need for a centralized authority to act as a bank,\u201d Johnson explains.\nKSI verifies the integrity of data by running hash functions on it and comparing the results against original metadata stored on the blockchain. \u201cThis is a fundamentally different approach to traditional security,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cRather than using Anti-Virus, Anti-Malware and Intrusion Detection schemes that search for vulnerabilities, you have mathematical certainty over the provenance and integrity of every component in your system.\u201d\nKSI is already being considered by organizations such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to protect sensitive military data, and by the Estonian eHealth Foundation to secure over one million health records.\nPreventing Distributed Denial of Service attacks\nOn October 21, millions of users across the U.S. were cut off from major websites such as Twitter, PayPal, Netflix and Spotify. The reason was a massive DDoS attack that brought down the DNS servers of service provider Dyn.\nThe episode was a reminder of how a weakness in the current backbone can become a bottleneck and a point of failure in a system that involves thousands and millions of nodes and users.\nBlockchain provides a fundamentally different approach to cybersecurity.\n\u201cThe killer weakness of the current DNS system is its overreliance on caching,\u201d says Philip Saunders, founder of Nebulis, a distributed, blank-slate DNS system. \u201cThis is what allows China to poison its DNS nameservers, censoring key social networks and banned keywords. At the same time it is also what makes it so easy for millions of autonomous devices under the control of malicious code to shut down whole networks and have these interruptions persist.\u201d\nBlockchain offers a solution, Saunders believes, a decentralized system would make it literally impossible for the infrastructure to fail under an excess of requests.\nNebulis uses the Ethereum blockchain and the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), a distributed alternative to HTTP\u2019s centralized structure, to make its DNS infrastructure immune to DDoS attacks.\n\u201cBlockchains, particularly the Ethereum platform, can allow a different approach,\u201d Saunders explains. \u201cOnly changes or updates to the record cost money in the form of network fees, but reads are free, as long as you have a copy of the blockchain.\u201d\nAs Saunders explains, with the Ethereum blockchain, you read straight from your own copy without imposing costs on the network. \u201cThis has great potential for lifting a great deal of pressure from the physical backbone of the internet,\u201d he says. \u201cIt also means we can do away with many of the redundancies of the traditional DNS and come up with something which is much better.\u201d\nThe team has finished the first draft of the Nebulis directory, which is currently undergoing testing. They plan to launch the first iteration of the directory soon.\nPreventing data theft in untrusted environments\nEncrypting data has now become a norm across organizations. However, when you want to act upon that data, you\u2019ll have to decrypt and reveal its contents.\n\u201cCurrently, there\u2019s really no option for computing over encrypted data in the market,\u201d says Guy Zyskind, founder and CEO of Enigma, a decentralized cloud platform based on blockchain. \u201cThe result is that we can only encrypt data at rest (i.e. while being stored on disk) or in-transit (sending over the wire), but not in-use. This means that when we process data, in whatever way or form, we end up decrypting it. This poses the usual risks associated with data breaches \u2014 an attacker with access to a system can see the plain-text data.\u201d\nAnother problem pertains to the fact that we live in an era of cloud and on-demand services, where our data is accessed and processed by untrusted third parties.\n\u201cThere are many situations where we want to jointly work on data without revealing our portion to untrusted entities,\u201d Zyskind says. \u201cThis happens constantly in the business world, where companies would like to collaborate without revealing sensitive information that they are prohibited from sharing due to security, privacy and even regulation reasons. Similarly, we\u2019re seeing more peer-to-peer systems where users themselves would like to maintain their privacy and anonymity.\u201d\nEnigma enables different participants to jointly store data and run computations while maintaining complete privacy. The platform uses blockchain to record time-stamped events and hashes of files that prevent attackers from hiding their tracks if they manipulate data.\nAdditionally, Enigma uses Multi-Party Computation (MPC), a cryptographic technology that performs computations by distributing data and tasks among multiple untrusted parties and making sure each party only has partial access to the data. \u201cThe parties are trusted as a whole, decentralized unit, but not individually,\u201d Zyskind explains.\nAccording to Zyskind, the combination not only prevents data from being tampered with, but also protects it from falling into the wrong hands. \u201cThe main point to consider is that the two technologies are complementary \u2014 both are needed to protect against a wide spectrum of cybersecurity threats,\u201d he says.\nThe paradigm can be used in several settings involving parties that cannot directly share data with each other but have the need to perform joint operations over it. Potential use cases involve simple tasks like bookkeeping, aggregations and generating simple statistics. It can also be used to train machine learning models over encrypted data sets owned by different parties.\nEnigma also can be used in fraud detection, where organizations can jointly execute fraud-detection algorithms over their encrypted data without compromising privacy.\nBlockchain and the future of cybersecurity\nBlockchain provides a fundamentally different approach to cybersecurity, which can go beyond endpoints and include user identity security, transaction and communication security and the protection of critical infrastructure that supports operations across organizations.\nThe paradigm shift represented by blockchain can provide the transparency and auditing that will enable us to make the most use of shared online services, while eliminating the potential security and privacy trade-offs.",

        "text": "But many have said that Mr. Ghani shares the blame for bringing General Dostum onto his ticket in the first place, despite grave concerns about the former warlord\u2019s human rights record.\nSpokesmen and aides to General Dostum could not be reached for comment about the warrants on Tuesday, but in recent weeks, they have rejected the summons against him as unconstitutional.\nBashir Ahmad Tayanj, a spokesman for General Dostum, said last month that the allegations were baseless and that the vice president had constitutional immunity from prosecution as part of the president\u2019s elected ticket.\nIn recent weeks, however, senior government officials say General Dostum\u2019s aides have been in contact with the attorney general\u2019s office, where they have been clearly told that the vice president has no choice but to cooperate. The general\u2019s aides have asked for time, two senior officials said.\nMr. Ishchi welcomed the news of the warrants and insisted that the bodyguards be arrested immediately. But he said justice would only be served once General Dostum\u2019s fate had been made clear. \u201cDostum committed an obvious crime, and when the crime is evident, the government can arrest the criminal even if he is a very high-profile person,\u201d he said.\nPhoto\nGeneral Dostum is part of a generation of Afghan warlords who stand accused of human rights violations, mostly during the country\u2019s civil war in the 1990s. But until now, most of those figures have seemed immune to the consequences, remaining in positions of power.\nBefore issuing the summons for General Dostum, the attorney general sought the support of Mr. Ghani and the national security council, which includes all the security ministries. A detailed plan of action was discussed at a meeting of the council, at which all the agencies pledged support for the prosecutors.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nGeneral Dostum\u2019s supporters have insisted that Mr. Ishchi was not abducted but, rather, arrested by security forces on charges of aiding the Taliban in Jowzjan Province.\nThe Interpreter Newsletter Understand the world with sharp insight and commentary on the major news stories of the week. Sign Up Thank you for subscribing. View all New York Times newsletters.\n\u201cForce, injury, and mistreatment \u2014 we cannot deny that, because in the past these accusations have been there against Afghan forces, that they mistreat suspects during arrest and interrogation,\u201d Mr. Tayanj said in the interview last month.\nBut he denied the accusation of sexual assault.\nBoth sides have also made emotional appeals to the public on the nightly news. On one news program, Mr. Tayanj presented a medical document that he said was from a government forensics examination; he said it disproved Mr. Ishchi\u2019s assertions of sexual assault but did not go into detail, simply brandishing the paper.\nA day later, Mr. Tayanj allowed two New York Times reporters to examine the document. It stated that there had been a wound next to Mr. Ishchi\u2019s rectum but that it had been treated, making it difficult to determine what had caused it.\nTwo other medical reports seen by The Times also attest to the presence of a significant wound. One was written by doctors at the United States military air base in Bagram, the other by doctors at the government-run Wazir Akbar Khan hospital, in Kabul.\nWhen the reporters pressed Mr. Tayanj about the wound, he said it was not evidence of sexual assault.\n\u201cIf someone hits someone with a rifle, no matter where they hit, is that sexual assault? Sexual assault has its own specific meaning,\u201d Mr. Tayanj said. \u201cThey have made it seem as if he was an 18-year-old girl who was taken and done something wrong to.\u201d\nAides to General Dostum have called for traditional mediation by tribal elders to resolve the issue, flatly rejecting the judicial process. He is also said to have sent a delegation of elders to negotiate with Mr. Ishchi.\nBaktash Ishchi, one of Mr. Ishchi\u2019s sons, said that they insisted on following the legal process and would not engage in traditional mediation.\n\u201cThis is not an issue for traditional mediation \u2014 it is not like he took our camel, so we accept a horse in return,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a crime that has taken place.\u201d",

        "text": "Dozens of foreign service officers and other career diplomats stationed around the world are so concerned about President Donald Trump's new executive order restricting Syrian refugees and other immigrants from entering the United States that they are contemplating taking the rare step of sending a formal objection to senior State Department officials in Washington.\nInterested in Immigration? Add Immigration as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Immigration news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\nIn recent days, drafts of a dissent memo have been circulating among diplomats and associates abroad expressing concern that the new restrictions \u2014 which Trump said would help \"keep America safe\" \u2014 are un-American and will actually paralyze efforts to stop terrorist attacks in the U.S.\n\"This ban ... will not achieve its stated aim to protect the American people from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals admitted to the United States,\" warned an early draft reviewed by ABC News.\nInstead, the executive order will expand anti-American sentiment and \"immediately sour relations\" with key allies in the fight against terrorism, particularly many of the countries whose citizens are now blocked from traveling to the United States, according to the draft.\nTrump's order indefinitely blocks Syrian refugees from coming to the United States, and it suspends immigration from six other countries still struggling to defeat terrorists within their borders: Iraq, Yemen, Somalia, Iran, Libya and Sudan.\nThe governments of those largely Muslim countries see the White House move as an attack on Islam. By \"alienating\" such allies, the U.S. government will lose access to valuable intelligence and counterterrorism resources, the draft said.\nThe draft also suggested Trump's \"knee jerk\" executive order was based on misguided notions about terrorism in the United States, noting that \"the overwhelming majority\" of terrorist attacks in the U.S. have been committed not by recent immigrants but by native-born or naturalized U.S. citizens \"who have been living in the United States for decades, if not since birth.\"\n\"Given the near absence of terror attacks committed in recent years\" by visa holders from Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Somalia, Iran, Libya or Sudan, \"this ban will have little practical effect in improving public safety,\" the draft concluded.\nIn fact, the executive order \"calls back to some of the worst times in our history,\" such as the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.\n\"Decades from now, we will look back and realize we made the same mistakes,\" the draft warned.\nOn Sunday, as law enforcement agencies were still scrambling to figure out how to implement the executive order and as protests broke out in cities across the country, the White House defended its action, saying the move was necessary \"to ensure that the people that we're letting into our country are coming here with peaceful purposes and not to do us harm.\"\n\"The safety of the American citizens, the safety of our country has got to be paramount,\" White House spokesman Sean Spicer told ABC News anchor Martha Raddatz on \"This Week.\"\nAsked what message the executive order sends to Muslims worldwide, Spicer said, \"What it sends is that we'll protect our country and people.\"\nHe said it's \"important to note\" that there are \"46 other countries with Muslim populations that are not part of this.\"\nThe draft memo reviewed by ABC News is separate from \u2014 and was more broadly circulated than \u2014 a memo sent over the weekend by the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad to the State Department, as reported by The Wall Street Journal. The embassy's memo warned that Trump's order could upend delicate military, political and business ties in the midst of a global fight against ISIS, according to The Wall Street Journal.\nAny new memo expressing concern over Trump's order would be sent to senior State Department officials through the dissent channel, which was created during the Vietnam War to help ensure that diplomats could document policy concerns and relay opposing views to high-level department officials.\nUsing it is considered so serious that in 1995 then\u2013Secretary of State Warren Christopher warned State Department officials, \"Because the dissent channel is not a routine channel and its messages are handled at the highest levels of the department, authors should ensure not only that their views are well grounded and well argued but that other channels are not available to them.\"\nIn its first 24 years, more than 200 messages were sent through the channel, according to Christopher.\nLast year, according to The New York Times, more than 50 diplomats filed a dissent memo with the Obama administration, expressing concern over U.S. policy in Syria and calling for military strikes against the Syrian regime.",

Alpha males are leaders, like Trump; beta males are portrayed as weak and emasculated.\nCrybaby, whiny: Anyone who disagrees with them or their preferred candidate, particularly protesters and people who complain that the alt-right is embracing racism and anti-Semitism.\nCuckservative, cuck: The term \"cuckservative\" originated in the alt-right. It's a portmanteau of \"conservative\" and \"cuckold\" used to describe Republicans who are perceived to be emasculated or \"selling out.\" Frequently shortened to \"cuck,\" the term has come under scrutiny for its racist implications.\nHuman biodiversity: Despite the fact that many say racism is at the heart of its platform, the alt-right is very sensitive about being called racist. They use the term \u201chuman biodiversity\u201d as a more scientific-sounding way of referring to issues of race.\nLibtard: The alt-right revels in the rejection of \"political correctness,\" so embracing an outdated term for a person with an intellectual disability (\"retard\") serves the purpose of insulting liberals.\nMasculinist: A word meant to embody the opposite of feminist, celebrating \u201cmanliness\u201d and the traditional \u201cheroic\u201d nature of men. To the alt-right, \"masculinist\" principles are ones that serve and advocate for men. Critics say they primarily reinforce antiquated gender roles.\nWhat is the alt-right? A refresher course on Steve Bannon's fringe brand of conservatism \u00bb\nMemes: The modern alt-right originated in places like 4chan and 8chan, which are hubs for meme creation. Meme creation is still a centerpiece of the movement. The alt-right is responsible for getting the Pepe the Frog meme classified as a hate symbol.\nMulticulturalism (as a derogatory term): A major component of the alt-right platform is white supremacy and nationalism. \"Multiculturalism\" is used as a negative term for the blending of multiple cultures, as opposed to celebrating the supposed superiority of Western European culture. . Often used as shorthand for policies that benefit immigrants and people of color.\nNeoreactionaries: Also known as NRx and the \"Dark Enlightenment.\" A group of people who call for stripping away anything other than supposedly rational thought, as opposed to a \u201cfeelings first\u201d mentality. They advocate for libertarianism, traditional gender roles and neofascism.\nPolitical correctness: Anything that challenges an alt-right person's right to say whatever they want, whenever they want, in any way they want to say it. According to the alt-right, political correctness is responsible for most of society's ills, including feminism, Islamic terrorism and overly liberal college campuses.\nSnowflake: Short for \"special snowflake,\" a pejorative for an entitled person. Most people protesting Trump are \"snowflakes,\" according to the alt-right, as are anti-Trump celebrities and most liberals.\nSJW: Short for \"social justice warrior,\" this insult is mostly reserved for young women who try to argue on behalf of liberal or feminist ideas.\nWhite genocide: What many alt-right members feel is the natural conclusion of liberalism and pro-immigrant policies. The alt-right views just about anything that benefits nonwhite people, particularly ones who aren't American citizens, as a risk to whiteness and a step on the road to the eradication of the white race.\nCAPTION California Atty.

        "text": "US intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in last month\u2019s presidential election to boost Donald Trump\u2019s bid for the White House, according to reports.\nA secret CIA assessment found that Russian operatives covertly interfered in the election campaign in an attempt to ensure the Republican candidate\u2019s victory, the Washington Post reported, citing officials briefed on the matter.\nA separate report in the New York Times said intelligence officials had a \u201chigh confidence\u201d that Russia was involved in hacking related to the election.\nThe claims immediately drew a stinging rebuke from the president-elect\u2019s transition team, which said in a statement: \u201cThese are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.\u201d\nAccording to the Post\u2019s report, officials briefed on the matter were told that intelligence agencies had found that individuals linked to the Russian government had provided WikiLeaks with thousands of confidential emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and others.\nThey told the paper that the people involved were known to US intelligence and acted as part of a Russian operation to boost Trump and hurt the chances of the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton. \u201cIt is the assessment of the intelligence community that Russia\u2019s goal here was to favour one candidate over the other, to help Trump get elected,\u201d one said.\nThe emails were steadily leaked via WikiLeaks in the months before the election, damaging Clinton\u2019s White House run by revealing that DNC figures had colluded to harm the chances of her nomination rival Bernie Sanders, and later giving examples of collusion between her campaign and figures in the media to blindside Trump in debates.\nPerson of the year shouldn\u2019t be Trump \u2013 it\u2019s clearly Putin | Jonathan Freedland Read more\nA separate report in the New York Times, also sourced to unnamed officials, claimed US intelligence agencies had discovered that Russian hackers had also penetrated the Republican National Committee\u2019s networks, but conspicuously chose to release only the information stolen from the Democrats.\nA third report, by Reuters, said intelligence agencies assessed that as the campaign drew on, Russian government officials devoted increasing attention to assisting Trump\u2019s effort to win the election. Virtually all the emails they released publicly were potentially damaging to Clinton and the Democrats, the official told Reuters.\n\u201cThat was a major clue to their intent,\u201d the official said. \u201cIf all they wanted to do was discredit our political system, why publicise the failings of just one party, especially when you have a target like Trump?\u201d\nA second official familiar with the report said the intelligence analysts\u2019 conclusion about Russia\u2019s motives did not mean the intelligence community believed that Moscow\u2019s efforts altered or significantly affected the outcome of the election.\nThe Kremlin has rejected the hacking accusations, while the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has previously said the DNC leaks were not linked to Russia. A second senior official cited by the Washington Post conceded that intelligence agencies did not have specific proof that the Kremlin was \u201cdirecting\u201d the hackers, who were said to be one step removed from the Russian government.\nCraig Murray, the former UK ambassador to Uzbekistan, who is a close associate of Assange, called the CIA claims \u201cbullshit\u201d, adding: \u201cThey are absolutely making it up.\u201d\n\u201cI know who leaked them,\u201d Murray said. \u201cI\u2019ve met the person who leaked them, and they are certainly not Russian and it\u2019s an insider. It\u2019s a leak, not a hack; the two are different things.\n\u201cIf what the CIA are saying is true, and the CIA\u2019s statement refers to people who are known to be linked to the Russian state, they would have arrested someone if it was someone inside the United States.\n\u201cAmerica has not been shy about arresting whistleblowers and it\u2019s not been shy about extraditing hackers. They plainly have no knowledge whatsoever.\u201d\nThe California Republican congressman Devin Nunes, chair of the House intelligence committee and a member of the Trump transition team, said: \u201cI\u2019ll be the first one to come out and point at Russia if there\u2019s clear evidence, but there is no clear evidence \u2013 even now. There\u2019s a lot of innuendo, lots of circumstantial evidence, that\u2019s it.\u201d\nOn Friday the White House announced that Obama had ordered intelligence officials to conduct a broad review of election-season cyber-attacks, including the email hacks, to report before he leaves office on 20 January.\nThe review, led by intelligence agencies, will be a \u201cdeep dive\u201d into a possible pattern of increased \u201cmalicious cyber activity\u201d during the campaign season, the White House spokesman Eric Schultz said. It would look at the tactics, targets, key actors and the US government\u2019s response to the recent email hacks, as well as incidents reported in past elections, he said.\n\u201cThe president wanted this done under his watch because he takes it very seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are committed to ensuring the integrity of our elections.\u201d\nSchultz said the president had ordered the inquiry as a way of improving US defence against cyber-attacks and did not intend to question the legitimacy of Trump\u2019s victory. \u201cThis is not an effort to challenge the outcome of the election,\u201d he said.\nThe Washington Post reported that US intelligence agencies were sceptical about the possibility that hackers would have been able to systematically manipulate the results of the election.\nA CIA spokeswoman told Reuters that the agency had no comment on the matter.",

Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, are expressing their skepticism over DeVos. They say they are not yet sure whether they will vote for her on the Senate floor.\nMurkowski says DeVos has yet to prove that she deeply cares about America\u2019s struggling schools and its children. Murkowski says the nominee has not yet earned her full support.\nThe Associated Press wrote this report.",

        "text": "Chris Connors never played by the rules and his family was determined that his obituary wouldn\u2019t either.\nFrom the first line about him dying of whiskey and stubbornness, the obit for the 67-year-old Maine resident published in the seacoastonline.com this week went on to detail a man who \u201clived 1,000 years in the 67 calendar years we had with him because he attacked life.\u201d\nConnors was stabbed saving a woman during a mugging in New York, got stranded in a life raft for 40 hours off Panama and reached base camp at Mount Everest at the age of 64. A Golden Gloves boxer from Quincy, Massachusetts, who went on to make a career on Wall Street, Connors was known for taking a swim in the ocean in January, occasionally cross dressing and leading a rousing night on the town with friends.\nHis passion for life was on display until the end, with one of his daughters recalling how he boxed with a bikini-clad hospice nurse and, 15 hours before he died, danced the Irish jig. His last words were curses.\n\u201cThe way he died is just like he lived: he wrote his own rules, he fought authority and he paved his own way,\u201d according to the obituary which has gone viral. \u201cAnd if you said he couldn\u2019t do it, he would make sure he could.\u201d\nConnors, who had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, and pancreatic cancer, died Dec. 9 at his home surrounded by his family. He had a wife and three children.\n\u201cHe was a rare combination of someone who had a love of life and a firm understanding of what was important \u2014 the simplicity of living a life with those you love,\u201d according to the obituary. \u201cAlthough he threw some of the most memorable parties during the greater half of a century, he would trade it all for a night in front of the fire with his family in Maine.\u201d\nConnors\u2019 daughter, Caitlin, wrote the obit with a cousin soon after her father died. Sitting around a fire with family members drinking, crying and celebrating, everyone just started sharing stories, she said, and the obit emerged.\nSince it was published, Caitlin Connors said the obit has gone viral with people calling it inspirational, refreshing and praising its celebratory tone. Some even wonder if all his stories were true \u2014 they are, she says \u2014 and others \u201cwishing they could have met him.\u201d\n\u201cI think he would be so happy,\u201d his daughter said, adding that her father had wanted the obit to be funny. She said the message she hoped to convey is \u201cnot to take life to seriously\u201d and pull more out of life \u201cthan what life gives you.\u201d\nShe said her father loved being a jokester and, \u201cNow, we got to share all these stories and people are inspired by it.\u201d\nCaitlin Connors said readers also have responded to the obit by donating $8,000 to the Chris Connors Fund , a boating and water safety program for York, Maine, and its surrounding community. The goal of the program is to save lives by promoting and teaching safer boating and water habits for kids.",

They said he was being taken to Orlando Regional Medical Center and will be transferred to the Orange County Jail after his hospital stay.\nAdvertisement\nRemembering Master Sergeant Debra Clayton\nAuthorities had been searching for Loyd, 41, in connection with the death of Sade Dixon, 24, and Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, who investigators said he fatally shot outside of the Walmart on Princeton Street on Jan. 9.\nAccording to authorities, Loyd was located around 7 p.m. in an abandoned house on Lescot Lane in Carver Shores. Police said the house was just down the street from the home of Clayton's mother.\nWhen he was captured, Loyd was wearing body armor and carrying two handguns. One of the weapons, a Glock handgun, had been modified to carry a 100-round drum of ammunition, Orlando police Cheif John Mina said.\nPolice said they were unsure how long Loyd had been living in the home.\nMina said Loyd resisted arrest and suffered facial injuries as a result.\nAs a bandaged Loyd was escorted away from police headquarters he yelled \"They beat me up. They beat me up.\"\nDuring a Tuesday night news conference, Mina said some officers finally let their emotions out after capturing Loyd.\n\"It's been a roller coaster of emotions throughout the entire week,\u201d he said.\nThen he discussed Master Sgt. Debra Clayton saying she \"risked her life for the community that she loves.\"\nWhen Loyd was arrested the handcuffs placed on him were Clayton's, Mina said.\nWhen asked about this move, it was revealed that at the department, it is custom to honor a fallen officer by placing the suspect connected in their death in the handcuffs that once belonged to that fallen officer.\nThe investigation into who might have assisted Loyd is not over. During the press conference, Mina said investigators believe Loyd had help while he was in hiding and said there could be more arrests in relation to the investigation.\nBut for now, the police chief said he's \"very happy no other officers, or citizens were hurt.\"\nEarlier in the day, before Loyd\u2019s capture, Mina said investigators believed Loyd changed his appearance. Police released a digitally altered photo of how Loyd would look without hair and provided new details about his physical appearance.\nPolice also said Loyd was likely wearing a bulletproof vest when he fatally shot Clayton.\nSince Clayton was killed, police have arrested a former supervisor at the fried-chicken restaurant where Loyd worked, an ex-girlfriend and his niece on charges of helping him evade capture in the weeks after Loyd's ex-girlfriend was fatally shot. Orlando police Chief John Mina said they were not cooperative in locating him.\nThe crime-tip service Crimeline offered a $100,000 reward for tips that would lead to his arrest.\nAfter Clayton was shot, many of her colleagues immediately joined the pursuit. Among them was sheriff's Deputy First Class Norman Lewis, who died when he was thrown from his motorcycle in an accident.",

        "text": "Jan 25, 2017\n\u2022 1 min read\nLeBron James wants the Cleveland Cavaliers to add a playmaker. Carmelo Anthony 's relationship with the New York Knicks is complicated. Thousands of words have been written about James and Anthony's friendship. Regardless of how little sense it makes for the Cavaliers and Knicks to make a trade, there has been speculation that it's a possibility, starting with Phil Jackson's friend, Charley Rosen, writing that Anthony would waive his no-trade clause for only two teams : the Cavs and the Los Angeles Clippers .\nESPN's Ryen Russilo, however, is reporting that there is no chance Anthony will wind up in Cleveland, as the defending champs simply aren't interested:\nA few thoughts here:\nThe idea of the Cavs trading Kevin Love for Anthony is hilarious. Love is in the middle of his best season since he left the Minnesota Timberwolves, and he's four years younger than Anthony. There is no indication Cleveland is trying to trade Love, but if the front office were to move him, you'd think general manager David Griffin would be looking primarily for a versatile, two-way player. Anthony is not that, and this kind of swap would hurt the Cavs' rebounding, ball movement, spacing and defense.\nIf Love isn't involved, it's extremely difficult to make a trade work. Would the Knicks consider Tristan Thompson and Iman Shumpert to be a good return for Anthony? Would Cleveland even be willing to part with Thompson? The idea of Shumpert, J.R. Smith or Channing Frye returning to Madison Square Garden in a lopsided Anthony trade is funny, but it's not particularly realistic.\nAs stupid as all of this sounds, it is actually pretty fun to imagine Anthony on this particular Cavs team -- as long as Love gets to stay. Anthony would get more open looks than he's had in years, and coach Tyronn Lue would have him exploit one-on-one mismatches the way he did in last year's playoffs. Despite all the pressure on the team, Anthony would carry much less of an individual burden than he does now. I don't blame people for thinking about how he'd fit, even though it's almost certainly not going to happen.\nI wish I had an alternative landing spot for Anthony. It's pretty much impossible to find a destination that really makes sense for both New York and the other side.",

        "text": "NFL National Lead WriterDecember 19, 2016\nComments\nMonday Morning Digest: Packers, Patriots Stay Hot on a Cold-Hearted NFL Sunday\n0 of 10\nJoe Robbins/Getty Images\nBaby, it was cold outside around the NFL on Sunday.\nThe Patriots like it cold, so they clinched the playoffs with temperatures in the teens in Denver. The Packers know a thing or two about tundra, so most of them didn't need sleeves to beat the Bears in single-digit conditions in Chicago. Negative wind chills made it so cold that Andy Reid's ability to make late-game decisions froze solid.\nOK, Reid could make bad late-game decisions on a spring day in San Diego. But still, it was cold out there. And even indoor and warm-weather teams felt a noticeable chill:\nThe Texans looked at the cold, hard facts and benched Brock Osweiler.\nThe Colts gave Adrian Peterson the cold shoulder in his return to the Vikings lineup.\nThe Lions' fourth-quarter comeback magic was put on ice by the Giants.\nThe Jaguars fired Gus Bradley. He had it coming, but still: that's cold.\nSo listen to that fireplace roar, have some coffee or cocoa (put some music on while we pour) and let Digest warm you up for the NFL stretch run!\nTop Story: Dak Prescott and the Cowboys Are Back in the Saddle\n1 of 10\nTom Pennington/Getty Images\nIf and when the Cowboys face the Patriots in the Super Bowl, Tony Romo probably gives them a better chance to win than Dak Prescott.\nBut by then, it will be a moot point.\nOne week after the ridiculous Sunday Night Romoquake, when a sizable portion of the world howled for Prescott to get benched after a bad game against the Giants, Prescott led the sloppy Cowboys to a 26-20 victory over the pesky Buccaneers.\nIt was a game the Cowboys tried hard to lose several times. But Prescott was having none of it. He completed 32 of 36 passes for 279 yards, rushing for 20 yards and a touchdown.\nIt was a night when the Cowboys defense gave up chunks of third-quarter yardage, when Dan Bailey missed a pair of field goals, when even Jason Witten coughed up a fumble. It was a night when the Cowboys dominated the first half but let the Buccaneers come back and take a 20-17 fourth-quarter lead.\nSo Prescott took over, leading a series of efficient field-goal drives. Yes, he relied on Ezekiel Elliott. Yes, the Cowboys stalled short of the end zone. But Prescott delivered sharp throws, particularly when the Cowboys were pinned in their own territory and needed a long drive to preserve their lead.\nThe Cowboys are succeeding with a particular brand of football. They run, run and run some more. Their defense bends but doesn't break.\nThey could use a few more sacks and turnovers from their defense. Sometimes, the offense is a little station-to-station while waiting for Elliott to hurdle the entire defense. But that's the system that has worked all year.\nIt's a system that has the Cowboys in the playoffs. It's not a system worth adding unpredictable variables to\u2014like, say, a rusty veteran quarterback with a reputation as a little bit of a risk-taker.\nAfter Sunday night's win, everyone understands that.\nPrescott is the best quarterback to get the Cowboys home-field advantage. He's the most likely one to complete short passes, rush a bit and play within the system no matter what the Cowboys face: the fading embers of the Legion of Boom, the dangerous (and similar to the Cowboys) Falcons, Aaron Rodgers on some vision quest, even...uh-oh...Round 3 against the Giants.\nThen, perhaps by the Super Bowl, the threat of Bill Belichick spending two weeks scheming to befuddle a rookie might make Tony Romo an appealing, if unlikely, best option.\nUntil then, let's table all of that silly \"bench Prescott\" nonsense and let the Cowboys keep doing what they do best.\nDigestible Nuggets\n2 of 10\nReed Hoffmann/Getty Images\nWhip-around coverage of what playoff hopefuls around the NFL (who are not covered in other slides) must do to stay in the race:\nFalcons: Winning two games without Julio Jones by a combined 83-27 score silenced most of your doubters. Now get Jones back and brace for some tougher, spoiler-minded NFC South competition.\nRavens: Never get sacked out of field-goal range. The 27-26 victory over the Eagles was too close for comfort, in part because Joe Flacco took a third-quarter sack that prevented Justin Tucker (who nailed 53- and 47-yarders in the wind) from doing his thing.\nBills: Don't try to figure out your playoff odds or memorize the combination of Bills wins and Dolphins-Broncos-Ravens-AFC South losses you need to reach the postseason. That could take days, and you need to figure out how to beat a decent opponent since the Patriots threw their injured third-string rookie quarterback at you in Week 4.\nPackers: That Aaron Rodgers-to- Jordy Nelson thing? Keep doing that.\nColts: Keep facing confused and disheartened opponents who are even less likely to play sound fundamental football than you are. (The official strategy of all AFC South champions!) But with the Raiders up next and the Texans and Titans finding ways to stay ahead in the standings, the Colts are probably cooked.\nChiefs: The guy who gained 68 yards on his first carry should probably be given a second carry sometime in the game. Maybe Tyreek Hill (pictured) would have been more worthy of a late-game rush (jet sweep, quick pitch, anything) when the Chiefs needed one first down to win the game than Charcandrick West or Alex Smith.\nRaiders: Congratulations on clinching the playoffs for the first time since televisions were low-def! Now: Stop. Allowing. Easy. Long. Touchdowns.\nSteelers: Settling for six field goals when your opponent has run out of surprises and is practically waiting for you to come back is the least Steelers thing the Steelers have done this year. Don't let it happen again, fellas.\nTitans: After spending the whole season establishing an identity as the NFL's most dedicated and diverse rushing team, don't spread the field and throw when you need a two-point conversion to take a late fourth-quarter lead. Andy Reid won't always be on the other sideline waiting to give you one more late opportunity.\nGame Spotlight: Patriots 16, Broncos 3\n3 of 10\nMatthew Stockman/Getty Images\nWhat Happened\nThe Patriots clobbered their former rivals for conference dominance with the huge, heavy hammer of reality.\nAfter some promising early drives, the Broncos offense settled into its depressing habit of going three-and-out in its own territory, usually with Trevor Siemian getting sacked or harassed on 3rd-and-long.\nThe Patriots offense had troubles of its own against the Broncos defense and the frigid conditions. But a Logan Ryan interception and runback set up a touchdown drive that allowed the Patriots to play for field position and field goals in the second half.\nThe end result was hardly a breathtaking Tom Brady vs. Peyton Manning duel of yesteryear. It was more like Brady vs. just another AFC team.\nWhat It Means\nThe Patriots defense has now played a string of excellent games after some wobbly moments in the middle of the season. As is often the case in New England, a new crop of contributors has performed well after previous defenders were shipped away.\nTrey Flowers (two sacks Sunday), Shea McClellin, Malcom Brown and others are making the midseason Jamie Collins controversy a distant memory. The defense is also making it easier for the Patriots to take control of games without needing to go into invincibility mode on offense.\nThe Broncos' playoff hopes got a boost from the Chiefs' last-second loss but suffered a blow when the Raiders won and the Dolphins kept wild-card pace with their Saturday night win.\nEach week, the Broncos look more like a one-and-done playoff team at best.\nWhat's Next\nThe Patriots continue their quest for home-field advantage by slapping the Jets around on Christmas Eve. The Broncos' gauntlet of nightmares continues with a trip to Kansas City.\nPlayer Spotlight: Brock Osweiler and Tom Savage, Quarterbacks, Texans\n4 of 10\nBob Levey/Getty Images\nWhat Happened\nYou know how sometimes you spend a ton of money on a family vacation only to discover that the hotel isn't up to snuff and the amusement park is too crowded and wild for your kids? You spend a few days desperately insisting that everyone have fun, enduring the stink-eye from your spouse as you march your terrified children onto roller coasters. Then you realize that everyone will be happier if you just declare the trip a lost cause, forget about the wasted money, head home and take everyone to the pool and movies for the rest of your time off.\nWell, the Texans benched human-money-macerator Brock Osweiler after two interceptions against the Jaguars. Into the game came Tom Savage (pictured), the former buzzy size-arm project who has now spent three seasons absorbing Bill O'Brien's wisdom.\nSavage differs from Osweiler in that Osweiler misses wide-open receivers by a mile, while Savage throws accurate passes to receivers who are blanketed by defenders. Savage led a bunch of late drives while completing 23 of 36 passes for 260 yards, engineering a comeback.\nThe 21-20 victory keeps the Texans in the playoff picture, just as driving home and ordering pizza kept your family from killing each other.\nWhat It Means\nA win is a win, and a shot at the playoffs is better than none.\nThat said, giving up on Osweiler\u2014no matter what is said or done this week, benching a quarterback against a last-place team in the heat of the playoff race is the definition of giving up on him\u2014sets the Texans' quarterback situation back two or three years. They officially have no faith in him, but they are financially obligated to keep him around for at least one more season.\nMaybe Savage is the answer. If so, then a) the answer was sitting under the organization's nose when it dropped its money safe on Osweiler, and b) the answer looks an awful lot like a third-year vet who just throws to his first read and, in order to win, needs a last-place opponent to commit special teams safeties and go three-and-out for an entire half.\nWhat's Next\nThe Bengals spent Sunday going three-and-out for the entire second half, patiently waiting for the Steelers to get their act together and come back. Sounds like the perfect Texans opponent, whomever they start at quarterback.\nGame Spotlight: Giants 17, Lions 6\n5 of 10\nJeff Zelevansky/Getty Images\nWhat Happened\nThe Lions have adopted a NASCAR-like strategy this season of lagging behind their opponent on purpose for three quarters of the game, as if to conserve fuel before making a late move.\nSo Matthew Stafford spent much of Sunday bouncing around the pocket and scrambling like he was auditioning for the off-Broadway production of Russell Wilson : The Musical. Zach Zenner even fumbled a would-be touchdown into the end zone for a touchback, lest the Lions take an early lead and be forced to cope with all of that wind drag.\nThe Giants offense remains a scattered collection of big plays separated by lots of punts, so they led just 10-6 entering the Lions' fourth-quarter witching hour. But Odell Beckham Jr. capped a late drive with a short touchdown, allowing the Giants secondary to take over. Stafford's late attempt at a miracle was thwarted by a Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie interception in the end zone.\nWhat It Means\nThe Giants defense is really good. The front four is stout despite Jason Pierre-Paul's absence, but the secondary of DRC, Landon Collins, Janoris Jenkins (who suffered a back injury before halftime), Eli Apple, Andrew Adams and Leon Hall is even better.\nThe Giants can win matchups with opponents down to their fourth or fifth receiving options, which is why Stafford and Dak Prescott suddenly looked like they had no idea what to do with the football over the last two weeks.\nThe Lions are in danger of becoming comic foils in the folktale of how the Packers once again conquered the NFC North. They are a good overall team\u2014but not a very good or great one\u2014whose luck may be turning.\nWhat's Next\nThe Giants face the feisty-but-futile Eagles on Thursday night. The Lions head to Dallas nervously clutching their rabbit's feet.\nPlayer Spotlight: Adrian Peterson, Running Back, Vikings\n6 of 10\nHannah Foslien/Getty Images\nWhat He Did\nAdrian Peterson performed another remarkable comeback from an injury that would sideline most 31-year-old running backs forever. Because let's face it: Most 31-year-old running backs are already sidelined forever.\nPeterson rushed six times for 22 yards, caught one pass for one yard and fumbled while fighting for extra yards in the red zone.\nHis comeback was part of a 34-6 reminder at the hands of the Colts that the Vikings have problems an aging Hall of Fame running back cannot solve.\nWhat It Means\nPeterson looked quick and sharp, so it's not like he is washed up or returned too soon from injury. But there was something sadly predictable about the Vikings' attempts to force their offense through him in the first quarter. The Colts shut down those early, Peterson-heavy drives, building a lead that quickly forced him out of the game plan.\nThe Vikings played like they expected Peterson to return and revitalize their offense. When it didn't happen, they were flat and listless on both sides of the ball. As an organization, they need to ween themselves off Peterson, reshape their offensive identity and fix their offensive line.\nAfter so many injuries this year, one more James-Brown-sheds-the-robe-and-grabs-the-microphone comeback from Peterson did not hurt the Vikings. But it didn't help, either.\nWhat's Next\nPeterson can help spoil the Packers' playoff bid as long as the Vikings stop expecting him to do it all by himself.\nSpecial Report: Jaguars Fire Gus Bradley\n7 of 10",

        "text": "HuffPost:\nAmericans Don\u2019t Buy The Claim That Trump\u2019s Inauguration Drew Record Crowds Just 7 percent think the event was better attended than Obama\u2019s 2009 swearing-in.\nYes, it matters that the truth is exposed. it makes a difference. people get it at their own speed, but Lincoln was right. You can\u2019t fool all of the people all of the time.\nx\nKaren Tumulty/WaPo:\nTrump\u2019s disregard for the truth threatens his ability to govern Until Trump\u2019s comments Monday night about illegal voters, it had appeared that the new administration might be regaining its footing after that wobbly start.\nNo, it did not. This is true only for reporters who project normalcy because they want to believe it. That\u2019s not reporting. That\u2019s wish fulfillment.\nThe failure by Trump and his team to maintain that discipline will do long-term damage, said Matthew Dowd, who was the chief strategist for George W. Bush\u2019s 2004 reelection campaign. \u201cI don\u2019t think he realizes how much he is hurting himself.\u201d\nx\nx\nTyler Cowan/Bloomberg:\nBy requiring subordinates to speak untruths, a leader can undercut their independent standing, including their standing with the public, with the media and with other members of the administration. That makes those individuals grow more dependent on the leader and less likely to mount independent rebellions against the structure of command. Promoting such chains of lies is a classic tactic when a leader distrusts his subordinates and expects to continue to distrust them in the future. Another reason for promoting lying is what economists sometimes call loyalty filters. If you want to ascertain if someone is truly loyal to you, ask them to do something outrageous or stupid. If they balk, then you know right away they aren\u2019t fully with you. That too is a sign of incipient mistrust within the ruling clique, and it is part of the same worldview that leads Trump to rely so heavily on family members. In this view, loyalty tests are especially frequent for new hires and at the beginning of new regimes, when the least is known about the propensities of subordinates. You don\u2019t have to view President Trump as necessarily making a lot of complicated calculations, rather he may simply be replicating tactics that he found useful in his earlier business and media careers.\nx\nRobin Wright/ New Yorker on Trump at the CIA:\nTrump\u2019s remarks caused astonishment and anger among current and former C.I.A. officials. The former C.I.A. director John Brennan, who retired on Friday, called it a \u201cdespicable display of self-aggrandizement in front of C.I.A.\u2019s Memorial Wall of Agency heroes,\u201d according to a statement released through a former aide. Brennan said he thought Trump \u201cshould be ashamed of himself.\u201d Crocker, who was among the last to see Ames and the local C.I.A. team alive in Beirut, was \u201cappalled\u201d by Trump\u2019s comments. \u201cWhatever his intentions, it was horrible,\u201d Crocker, who went on to serve as the U.S. Ambassador in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Lebanon, and Kuwait, told me. \u201cAs he stood there talking about how great Trump is, I kept looking at the wall behind him\u2014as I\u2019m sure everyone in the room was, too. He has no understanding of the world and what is going on. It was really ugly.\u201d \u201cWhy,\u201d Crocker added, \u201cdid he even bother? I can\u2019t imagine a worse Day One scenario. And what\u2019s next?\u201d\nx\nNBC:\nSome Experts Say Trump Team\u2019s Falsehoods Are Classic \u2018Gaslighting\u2019 And while Trump's controversial campaign comments have spawned a new genre of of fact-checking columns, many of his supporters predicted he'd become somehow more presidential, and less likely to be provocative, once he took office. So why even do it? The behavior has all the signs of \"gaslighting\", says clinical psychologist Bryant Welch, who wrote a 2008 book entitled \"State of Confusion: Political Manipulation and the Assault on the American Mind\". Gaslighting refers to a 1944 film in which a murdering husband manipulates and confuses his wife by dimming the gas lights in their home and then denying it's happening. \"The very state of confusion they are creating is a political weapon in and of itself,\" Welch told NBC News. \"If you make people confused, they are vulnerable. By definition they don't know what to do,\" added Welch, who has not personally examined any of the Trump team.\nEast Lansing Info:\nEast Lansing Board of Education has passed a resolution urging all U.S. senators to vote \u2018no\u2019 on the confirmation of Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education as proposed by President Trump. The motion, proposed by Karen Hoene and seconded by Erin Graham, mentioned DeVos\u2019s lack of experience with public schools, and her history of support of non-public charter schools. They also mentioned her \u201ctroubling history of financially supporting organizations whose actions are detrimental to LGBTQ students.\u201d The full document can be found here.\nx\nGizmodo on why scientists are speaking out (examples below):\nScience\u2019s ultimate goal is to establish truth and facts by accumulating evidence. When the administration chooses to speak falsely to the American people, it\u2019s up to scientists, the ones who work tirelessly to figure out what\u2019s true, to stand up for evidence-based reasoning. \u201cI think that if we see a situation where people are being encouraged to ignore objective reality, it\u2019s kind of improtant to push back against that,\u201d Katherine (Katie) Mack, astrophysicist at the University of Melbourne in Australia, told Gizmodo, \u201cas people who have an interest in the idea that we can understand and interact with the world as it is.\u201d\nx\nKevin Folta/Blogspot talks to us about an ongoing attempt to suppress science:\nSo why do well-funded industry front groups want to confiscate my correspondence with the media? Beats me, but I have several hypotheses:\n1. Smearing Science-Friendly Journalists. We know that they used my emails to develop damaging false narratives, using complicit reporters and venues like the New York Times. I fully expect that they'll use these emails to make it look like I share cozy relationships with the journalists in question, and then claim that those associations mean they can't be trusted to report science accurately. The people targeted report objectively on biotechnology and incorporate my two cents into their independent syntheses, or not . Activists seek to destroy the perception of their independent credibility and journalistic integrity.\nOf course, I've only met these folks here and there, served on panels with them, participated in conferences, maybe had phone calls. I had a hamburger with one once in Davis, CA, sushi with another in Gainesville, FL. Nothing terribly exciting, but it will be blown up into wild, evil collusion.\n2. Dissuade Journalists from Talking to Scientists. Those that report science are less likely to do it if their questions and sources will end up as part of broad public records searches. Heck, the same journalists use records requests all the time and appreciate transparency that FOIA provides. But when private emails turn into the basis of broad fishing trips, looking for \"gotchas\" and cherry-picked bits that can be pulled from context with intent to permanently harm reputations? It is the abuse of transparency law that journalists appropriately decry, and likely to turn a reporter away from my university if they have a question or concern in a hot-topic area.\n3. Chilling Science Communication. If scientists are afraid to talk, and nobody is going to report it, it ensures complete suppression of the scientific message. They both gag the voice and cut the wires. Severing all ties between scientists and the best journalists is their goal, as activist messages fail to find publication outside of their own websites.\nPeter Broks/Wordpress:\nScience communication has failed Rearranging the furniture in the White House are a President who said climate change was a hoax, and a Vice-President who does not accept the theory of evolution. The rest of Trump\u2019s cabinet is an equally deplorable bunch when it comes to science (or, indeed, anything else when it comes to being decent and humane). I\u2019m not blaming science communication for the election of Trump. But Trump\u2019s Presidency is evidence that science communication has failed. You might say that this has little to do with science communication, that Trump won the election on other issues but this only shows that science-based issues were not seen as important enough \u2013 also a failure. And Brits should not be so smug either, with their vote for Brexit and their \u201chad enough of experts\u201d. What we have clearly seen in recent months is that facts are not enough no matter how well they are communicated. The campaign to remain in the E.U. had all the facts, all the statistics, all the information. In contrast, the leave campaign was built on lies, half-truths and prejudices. The U.K. voted to leave. Facts are not enough. Science communication is not enough. More is not enough. How many years have we spent trying \u201cto get the message across\u201d? How many years of \u201cooooh\u201d, \u201caaahhh\u201d, \u201cwow\u201d\u2026..applause? Failure. I\u2019m not suggesting that we stop trying to disseminate accurate science. Far from it. In this \u201cpost-truth\u201d age of \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201calternative facts\u201d, the need for good science communication has never been more urgent. What I am suggesting is that we need to change our approach, not just a better version, or an upgrade \u2013 a radical shift, not pimp my sci-comm.\nGuardian:",

That is also the right answer: that you have to differentiate.\n\u2018The fact that some people want to exploit that is something we have to withstand and defend ourselves against.\u2019\nIraqi asylum seeker Zaid K (pictured) has been arrested in Germany for sexually assaulting two Chinese students.\nInterior Minister Thomas de Maiziere, a close Merkel ally, said an official report about crimes committed by refugees, published this week, showed it was unfair to tar all newcomers with the same brush.\nHe said there were various anomalies in the report \u2013 asylum seekers from Georgia, for example, were more likely to be convicted of property crimes.\nMerkel is facing growing alarm among Germans about migrant numbers after more than a million asylum seekers were allowed to enter the country last year.\nShe has been furiously backtracking on some policies in the face of opinion polls which shows a surge in support for the right-wing populist party, the Alternative f\u00fcr\u00a0Deutschland (AfD).\nOn Monday she did a U-turn and said the burka should be banned in Germany \u2018wherever that is legally possible\u2019.\nThe AfD this week directly linked Merkel\u2019s \u2018open door\u2019 policy on migrants to the sex crimes against the three students.\nEarlier this week the German media was full of stories about a 31-year-old Iraqi asylum seeker Zaid K, who has been arrested for sexually assaulting two Chinese students.\nThe man was seized five days after illegal Afghan migrant Hussein Khavari, 17, was apprehended for the rape and murder of medical student Maria Ladenburger\u00a0in Freiburg.\nZaid K came to Germany in 2015 and lived with his wife and two children near the scene of the two attacks in the city of Bochum.\nHussein Khavari (right), 17, has been linked by his DNA to the murder of Maria Ladenburger (left), 19, a medical student whose father is a legal adviser to the European Commission in Brussels.\nProsecutors say he struck twice: once in August when he seriously injured a 21-year-old student after he attempted to rape her, and again in November.\nIn the second attack a 27-year-old Chinese woman reported that she was attacked and raped.\nPolice say the boyfriend of victim number one took photos of the suspect lingering at the crime scene days later. These led detectives to the refugee home where he lived.\nPolice murder squad chief Roland Wefelscheidt said: \u2018The photos were pin sharp and we had no trouble identifying him at the asylum centre.\u2019\nDNA evidence from both crime scenes has linked him to the attacks, according to police and prosecutors.\nThe man is now being investigated for other unsolved sex crimes in the area.\nThe killing of 19-year-old Maria Ladenburger (pictured) has enraged people in Freiburg.\nYesterday it was revealed that migrants committed 1,576 sex crimes in Germany in 2015. In the first half of this year the figure already stood at 1683.\nThe most notorious sex attacks occurred in Cologne on New Year\u2019s Eve when mobs of North African men sexually assaulted and robbed hundreds of women.\nInternet abuse against migrants is rising since the arrest last Friday of the Afghan teen accused of murdering Maria Ladenburger in October.\nMaria, daughter of a high-ranking EU bureaucrat, was ironically a refugee helper in her spare time. She was taped then drowned in a river after her attacker ambushed her as she rode home on her bicycle from a party.\nMaria worked in her spare time in the ancient university city of Freiburg helping out the migrants in various shelters and homes.\nLet the world know and share this:",

        "text": "The Shorenstein Center at the Kennedy School of Government has released a new report about the press coverage of the 2016 election. It reads less like an analysis of the performance of a free press and more like the autopsy of someone who threw himself in front of a train.\nMuch of the candidates' \"good press\" was in the context of the horserace\u2014who is winning and who is losing and why. At any given moment in the campaign, one of the candidates has the momentum, which is a source of positive coverage. Figure 2 shows the tone of the nominees' coverage on non-horserace topics, those that bear some relationship to the question of their fitness for office\u2014their policy positions, personal qualities, leadership abilities, ethical standards, and the like. In Trump's case, this coverage was 87 percent negative to 13 percent positive. Clinton's ratio was identical\u201487 percent negative to 13 percent positive. \"Just like Tweedledum and Tweedledee,\" as Barry Goldwater said dismissively of America's two parties in the 1960s.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\nThis is the destructive power of the horserace coverage, which is the easiest way to cover politics and the least informative.\nThe horserace was the main focus of Clinton's coverage, accounting for more than two-fifths of her coverage. Her policy positions received less attention than did Trump's (9 percent versus 12 percent) and the coverage was less focused. Whereas his position on immigration received considerable attention, she did not have a single policy issue that accounted for more than 1 percent of her coverage. If she had a policy agenda, it was not apparent in the news. Her lengthy record of public service also received scant attention.\nWhich is at least partly how all those Rust Belt voters came to believe that \"nobody\" was listening to them. And, while the report also finds that the coverage of Donald Trump was almost uniformly negative, it appears to have been the emphasis on the horserace coverage that balanced the whole thing out and created a level playing-field as regards the respective qualifications of the two candidates for the office that never should have been there in the first place.\nCriticism dogged Hillary Clinton at every step of the general election. Her \"bad press\" outpaced her \"good press\" by 64 percent to 36 percent. She was criticized for everything from her speaking style to her use of emails. As Clinton was being attacked in the press, Donald Trump was attacking the press, claiming that it was trying to \"rig\" the election in her favor. If that's true, journalists had a peculiar way of going about it. Trump's coverage during the general election was more negative than Clinton's, running 77 percent negative to 23 percent positive. But over the full course of the election, it was Clinton, not Trump, who was more often the target of negative coverage (see Figure 1). Overall, the coverage of her candidacy was 62 percent negative to 38 percent positive, while his coverage was 56 percent negative to 44 percent positive.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\nThe greatest failure of all the institutions that failed to keep a mountebank like the president-elect out of office\u2014and this is especially true of this particular institution\u2014was a persistent inability to recognize how sui generis he, and his campaign, and its appeal, really were, and how dangerous that was. The Clinton campaign never really got a handle on it and that was what doomed it late in the game. The press appeared to recognize it only as a shiny object and not as a genuine threat to democratic institutions, including itself. My guess is that a lot of people in my business either will ignore this report, or dismiss it as the work of parachuting dilettantes. Which means that nothing will change, and nothing will be solved.\nClick here to respond to this post on the official Esquire Politics Facebook page.",

        "text": "\u2022 Hot Stove Tracker\nIn order to acquire Eaton, the Nationals traded Lucas Giolito, Reynaldo Lopez and Dane Dunning, three right-handed pitchers that were the club's Nos. 1, 3 and 6 prospects as rated by MLBPipeline.com. Giolito is baseball's No. 3 overall prospect and Lopez comes in at No. 38. General manager Mike Rizzo has normally been reluctant to trade his top Minor Leaguers, so this marks his most aggressive unloading of Minor League talent in his Nats tenure.\nThis was a statement that the Nationals are trying to capitalize on their championship window now after winning 95 games in 2016 and their third National League East title in the past five seasons. But they have yet to advance past the NL Division Series.\nCouldn't be more excited to join a very talented @Nationals team! Should be a heck of a 2017! See you at #NatsWinterfest \u2014 Adam Eaton (@AdamSpankyEaton) December 8, 2016\n\"We feel comfortable with the deal,\" Rizzo said. \"We got ourselves a good, young skillful player that we can control at below market values for five seasons and, again, you got to give to get.\"\n\"It was a great honor to play for the South Side of Chicago, they deserve a great team and I'm sure [general manager] Rick [Hahn] will make sure that happens,\" Eaton wrote in a text to MLB.com. \"I'm excited for my new home in D.C., joining a great team with a lot of talent. Can't wait to get started.\"\nNationals trade for Eaton Justice discusses Nats' trade for outfielder Eaton MLB.com columnist Richard Justice discusses why the Nationals traded for center fielder Adam Eaton\nThe deal came together quickly after the Nats laid the groundwork with the White Sox this week in negotiations for left-hander Chris Sale, who was ultimately traded to Boston.\nStill, a year ago, trading Giolito would have seemed unthinkable for the Nationals. He was the top prospect in baseball then and Washington saw him as a future ace at the top of its rotation. But Giolito's stock fell after struggling in his Major League debut. He pitched in six games (four starts) and posted a 6.75 ERA with 11 strikeouts and 12 walks in 21 1/3 innings, while his velocity dipped from the mid-to-upper 90s on his scouting report to the mid-to-lower 90s. It's still a small Major League sample, but opinions on Giolito are beginning to differ on whether he will be a dominant starter.\nLopez also struggled in his debut in the Majors this past season, posting a 4.91 ERA in 11 games with 42 strikeouts and 22 walks in 44 innings. But he was effective as a reliever and made the postseason roster in the bullpen, so perhaps he best profiles as a relief option. And the Nats selected Dunning in the first round of the Draft this past June.\n\"To acquire a player with this skill set that has the years of control and favorable contract that he has, it takes good players in return. ... We traded from a position of depth,\" Rizzo said. \"We felt we have great depth in our starting pitching. We utilized that to turn a hole in our lineup and we dealt from strength and depth to correct that, and we still like the depth that we have beyond the Major League rotation.\"\nThe Nationals did not commit to anything Wednesday night, but the trade should allow Trea Turner to shift to his natural position at shortstop while Eaton takes over in center field.\nIn 2016, Eaton hit .284/.362/.428 while playing primarily right field, where he was an American League Gold Glove Award finalist, and his 22 Defensive Runs Saved was second most in the Majors at his position. However, the Nats prefer to keep Bryce Harper in right field and believe Eaton can still be a solid defensive center fielder. He was for Chicago in 14, when he posted 12 DRS, but he then posted -14 DRS in '15 and the White Sox moved him to right field. Eaton has a strong arm and should be able to use his athleticism in center field.\n\"Adam fit our club perfectly,\" Rizzo said. \"Left-handed bat, balanced our lineup, high energy guy, edge to him, plays the game the right way, good hitter, good defensive player both in center field and outstanding in the corner, a productive player throughout his career. We see the arrow still going up with him.\"\nZinkie on White Sox-Nats trade Zinkie examines fantasy impact of White Sox-Nats deal MLB.com fantasy writer Fred Zinkie discusses the fantasy impact of the White Sox and Nationals trade, featuring Adam Eaton and Lucas Giolito\nFantasy spin | Fred Zinkie (@FredZinkieMLB)\nEaton has posted an impressive .286/.362/.430 slash line since the outset of 2015, averaging 14 homers, 16 steals and 94 runs per year over that span. Set to occupy a premium spot in a Washington lineup that was far more productive than Chicago's last season, the outfielder should be a five-category asset with the potential to score 100-plus runs for the first time in his career. By adding Eaton and moving Turner to shortstop, the Nationals will push Danny Espinosa (24 homers in '16) to their bench -- and mixed-league waiver wires.\nMeanwhile, Giolito and Lopez should compete for spots in an unsettled White Sox rotation. But while Giolito is ranked among the top prospects in baseball and Lopez also has a solid Minor League track record, both should open 2017 on waivers in mixed formats after struggling with the Nats a year ago. In Chicago's outfield, Eaton's departure may open up a starting role for prospect Charlie Tilson -- a fleet-footed 24-year-old with solid contact skills who could help owners in 15-team leagues.",

        "text": "Taiwan scrambled jets Wednesday as China's sole aircraft carrier led Chinese warships through the Taiwan Strait with all eyes on Russia, a U.S. defense official confirmed to Fox News.\nCRUZ MEETS WITH TAIWANESE PRESIDENT, BLASTS CHINA\nIt was the second time China sailed the aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, through the strait in the past few weeks, with tensions between Beijing and Taiwan escalating. The carrier was traveling northwest along the center line dividing the strait, along with its battle group.\nIt came a few days after China flew another nuclear-capable H-6 bomber down to a set of contested islands in a show of force. The bomber flew around the Spratly Islands on Sunday.\nVIDEO: CHINESE MILITARY RATTLES NEIGHBORS IN SOUTH CHINA SEA\nTaiwan's military was closely monitoring the ships' passage and urged the public not to be alarmed. Taiwan regularly dispatches planes and ships to keep a watchful eye on Chinese forces' movements around the island, although the military gave no details about its specific response.\nThe heavily trafficked 100-mile-wide Taiwan Strait separates Taiwan from southeastern China. The carrier was on its way back from its first journey to the Western Pacific, where it carried out a training exercise, Reuters reported.\nBased on a Soviet-built platform and commissioned in 2012, the Liaoning earlier this month carried out what Beijing called routine combat drills in the South China Sea. China has fortified the area with seven man-made islands, some containing runways and coastal defenses.\nChina declared in November that the carrier and its complement of J-15 fighter jets were combat-ready, setting off jitters in an already tense region.\nThe Liaoning set off for the Western Pacific last month, passing through the Miyako Strait, south of Okinawa, and then the Bashi Channel separating Taiwan from the Philippines as it entered the South China Sea.\nJapanese and Taiwanese surveillance aircraft and ships closely monitored the Liaoning along its journey, seen by some as a sign of how China plans to use the carrier to demonstrate its willingness to back up its territorial claims with military muscle.\nChina and Taiwan split amid civil war in 1949 and Beijing has never renounced its threat to use force if it considers that necessary to prevent the island's permanent independence from the mainland.\nRelations between the sides have deteriorated badly since Taiwanese elected independence-leaning President Tsai Ing-wen last year, and Chinese officials have warned of more turbulence ahead unless she endorses Beijing's view that Taiwan is part of China.\nChina has been steadily ratcheting-up the economic and political pressure on Tsai, discouraging Chinese tourists from visiting the island of 23 million and intervening to prevent its participation in international forums. That has fueled speculation that Beijing will seek to win away more of the island's dwindling number of diplomatic allies, which now stand at just 21.\n\"Looking ahead in 2017, the development of cross-strait relations faces increased levels of uncertainty and the challenge of risk has risen,\" Ma Xiaoguang, spokesman for the Cabinet's Taiwan Affairs Office, told reporters at a bi-weekly briefing on Wednesday.\nMa said he had no information on the Liaoning's passage through the Taiwan Strait and referred questions on the matter to the Defense Ministry, which did not immediately respond.\nHaving been thoroughly overhauled in China, the Liaoning represents a new degree of sophistication in the Chinese armed forces that includes ballistic missile submarines and prototype stealth fighters.\nChina announced in 2015 that it was building additional carriers entirely with domestic technology.\nFox News' Lucas Tomlinson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Washington: He lied \u2013 again. US President Donald Trump had car manufacturers in on Tuesday, giving them the rounds of the kitchen for locating their factories abroad \u2013 but assuring them he'd reduce \"out of control\" environmental regulations.\nAnd lest he be seen as the climate vandal that most in the environmental movement fear he is, Trump touted his greenie credentials at the meeting: \"I'm a very big person when it comes to the environment \u2013 I've received awards on the environment.\"\nNope! And when reporters asked for a list of the awards, the White House referred them to a book. Nope, again \u2013 instead of listing what the President had won, it listed what the author, Trump's longtime environmental consultant, thought he should have won.\nBut Trump's encounter with the car makers proved to be just a warm-up act for his inner vandal \u2013 later in the morning fears that he would drag the US back towards the yesteryears of fossil fuels were confirmed with his decision to revive two controversial projects, the Keystone XL and the Dakota Access oil pipelines.\nIt's hard not to conclude that this is all about money: on news of his election victory shares in companies making solar panels and wind turbines dropped by up to 10 per cent, but shares in Peabody Energy \u2013 the biggest US coal company \u2013 were up more than 50 per cent.\nAnd viewed through the prism of the Trump dealmaker's logic, there might even be some commercial sense in the environmentalist notion that Trump is the last man who can help energy firms who find themselves stranded in a fast-changing world, because they are still sitting on huge fossil energy reserves fast being rendered useless by advances in renewable energy.\nAdvertisement\nBritish activist writer George Monbiot writes: \"Trump is the man who will let them squeeze every last cent from their oil and coal reserves before they become worthless.\n\"They need him because science, technology and people's demands for a safe and stable world have left them stranded. There is no fight they can win. So their last hope lies with a government that will rig the competition.\"\nSHARE\nShare on Facebook SHARE\nShare on Twitter TWEET\nLink President Donald Trump's election has cost the bookies plenty. Photo: AP\nTrump's move on the two pipelines was part of a first-days-in-office smashing of things precious to his predecessor \u2013 who for all his sober handling of so many issues was passionate on the issue of climate change.\nSo, within minutes of Trump swearing the oath of office on Friday, the White House website that showcased the Obama administration's climate change policies disappeared into the ether, and was replaced with a statement on Trump's energy policy, which promises to reduce \"burdensome regulations on our energy industry\".\nSHARE\nShare on Facebook SHARE\nShare on Twitter TWEET\nLink Happy days are here to stay longer? Exxon Mobil's Billings Refinery in Billings, Montana.

He wants to shred a raft of energy and environmental regulations. He is committed to opening swaths of federal land to oil, gas and coal drilling and production. He thinks the Environmental Protection Agency should be all but neutered.\nAnd he plans to put an axe through Obama's Clean Power Plan, which was to pressure electricity firms to reduce carbon emissions and the Waters of the US rule, which protects the country's big rivers and their smaller tributaries.\nSHARE\nShare on Facebook SHARE\nShare on Twitter TWEET\nLink Ford Motors CEO Mark Fields, left, and General Motors CEO Mary Barra outside the White House in Washington.

And according to reports on his record in Oklahoma, his decisions on how to handle cases seemed to have been made on the basis of the political donations he received.\nSome environmentalists seem utterly defeated \u2013 Bill McKibben, founder of the climate action group 350.org, told The Washington Post: \"I really don't know ... We'll do what we can, but truthfully, the path forward is not all that clear to me.\"\nOthers are girding for a fight. Recalling the early days of the George W. Bush administration, Friends of the Earth president Erich Pica said: \"[We] utilised the courts, the Senate filibuster, watchdogged political appointees and galvanised the public to take action \u2013 we'll have to take these same actions ... the environmental movement is stronger than we've ever been.\"\nBoth Pruitt and Rick Perry, the former Texas governor who as a presidential candidate could not remember the name of the Energy Department he intended to abolish, but who will lead that department under Trump, conceded in their Senate confirmation hearings that human activity had an impact on the climate, but they also showed themselves to be sceptics \u2013 either waffling or by bouncing questions as \"academic\" or \"immaterial\".\nAll but the last 330 metres of the 1880-kilometre Dakota Access pipeline, to move oil from the North Dakota shale oil reserves to Illinois, has been built \u2013 but in December a stop was ordered to allow alternate routes to be considered for the last stretch in the face of Native American protests that their water supplies could be affected.\nAnalysts say that the potential for job creation or environmental damage from the Keystone XL pipeline, which is intended to carry 800,000 barrels a day from Canada to the Gulf Coast, is minimal \u2013 but the project became a lightning rod as a test of Washington's preparedness make a call either to promote energy production or act to protect the environment. Obama dithered for years, but ultimately rejected the project on the eve of the Paris emissions conference, arguing that to proceed would have diminished US leadership in weaning the world off fossil fuels.\nAt his meeting with the automakers, Trump promised easier regulation: \"We're going to make the process much more simple for the auto companies and for everyone else who wants to do business in the US. You're going to find this to be [a shift] from being very inhospitable to extremely hospitable.\"\nAnd trying to at least be seen to be environmentally conscious, he added: \"I am, to a large extent, an environmentalist \u2013 I believe in it. But it's out of control and we're going to make it a very short process.\n\"And we're going to either give you your permits or we're not going to give you your permits \u2013 but you're going to know very quickly and, generally speaking, we're going to be giving you your permits.\"",

        "text": "Four British companies are alleged to have played a key part in a multimillion pound bribery scandal involving a leading Italian politician.\nLuca Volont\u00e8, a former member of the Union of the Centre party in Italy, has been accused of helping quash a human rights report criticising Azerbaijan, one of the world\u2019s most authoritarian countries. The Observer has also established that one of the UK companies was allegedly linked to a scandal involving Russian organised crime.\nVolont\u00e8, who is also president of the European People\u2019s party in the Council of Europe, is being investigated by the Milan public prosecutor\u2019s office for allegedly accepting \u20ac2.39m in bribes.\nIt is claimed that Volont\u00e8 received the money in exchange for persuading the People\u2019s party to vote against a 2013 report by the council, Europe\u2019s leading human rights organisation, that highlighted the plight of political prisoners in Azerbaijan. He denies any wrongdoing.\nSeveral months after the report criticising Azerbaijan was rejected by EU member state politicians, the European commission announced the construction of the controversial Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) bringing gas from Azerbaijan to Europe.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Luca Volont\u00e8, an Italian politician, has been accused of accepting bribes to quash a report into the plight of political prisoners in Azerbaijan. Photograph: Vano Shlamov/AFP/Getty Images\nCampaign groups claim that the publication of the council\u2019s report, drafted by a German Social Democrat MP, Christoph Strasser, would have invited public scrutiny of alleged abuses in the country, and raised questions about Europe\u2019s backing for the pipeline.\nStrasser told the Italian broadcaster RAI: \u201cBy rejecting my report, Azerbaijan saved its reputation and nobody had nothing to say when they started doing business [in Europe].\u201d\nTAP is part of the giant Euro-Caspian Mega Pipeline which will run across Georgia, Turkey, Greece, Albania and Italy. Once completed it will bring gas to Europe from the BP-operated Shah Deniz fields in the Caspian Sea off Azerbaijan\u2019s coast.\nPayments made to Volont\u00e8 via the four UK companies were revealed in an Italian documentary. Volont\u00e8 confirmed to the programme\u2019s makers that he was paid for advice which he \u201cpersonally provided to Elkhan Suleymanov\u201d, a good friend of Azerbaijan\u2019s president, Ilham Aliyev. He has said he was only paid for giving agricultural advice.\nThe four UK companies appear to have been shell companies with no operations in the UK and are now dissolved. The European Stability Initiative thinktank has named them as LCM Alliance LLP, based in Potters Bar, Hilux Services and Polux Management, both of Glasgow, and Metastar Invest, whose HQ is registered at a service address in Birmingham. All four were ultimately controlled by companies in tax havens.\nRecords show that one of the UK-registered companies allegedly used to funnel the payments \u2013 Metastar, a limited liability partnership (LLP) now dissolved \u2013 was run by two \u201cmembers\u201d: Advance Developments Ltd and Corporate Solutions Ltd. Both firms, also now dissolved, were based in Belize and controlled a vast network of UK-registered LLPs, including one called Armut Services.\nAzerbaijan dissidents warn the west not to fall for Baku's flashy facade Read more\nDocuments filed with the Latvian courts allege that Armut helped siphon off $230m of funds paid by the hedge fund Hermitage Capital Management to the Russian treasury.\nThe scandal involved an organised Russian criminal syndicate, the Klyuev Group, which, it is claimed, has stolen at least $800m from the Russian people with the aid of the Russian government.\nSergei Magnitsky, a lawyer working for Hermitage, blew the whistle on the scandal only to be imprisoned in Russia. It is alleged that Magnitsky was tortured to force him to withdraw his testimony. While in prison he developed gallstones, pancreatitis and a blocked gall bladder. A human rights council set up by the Kremlin found that he was physically assaulted shortly before his death, which was the direct result of being denied urgent medical care needed to treat his conditions.\nEmma Hughes of Platform, a group that campaigns against the fossil fuel industry, said the involvement of UK tax havens in the alleged bribery scandal should act as a wake-up call for the British government. \u201cThis alleged corruption scandal is yet another example of how the opacity created by tax havens is used to fuel corruption and bribery around the world,\u201d she said.\n\u201cUntil the UK changes the law to tackle this it is facilitating criminality. It should begin by approving an amendment to the criminal finances bill which would enable the UK to freeze the assets of people who are involved in, or profit from, human rights abuses.\u201dThe Trans Adriatic Pipeline has been a longstanding source of controversy. William Hague, when foreign secretary, gave his blessing to the project claiming that it would reduce the UK\u2019s dependency on Russian gas.\nHowever, others disagree. \u201cIn actuality the Euro-Caspian Mega Pipeline is likely to be used to feed Russian gas to Europe as the pipeline has been designed to interconnect with the Russian pipeline grid,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cTAP will lock Europe into polluting fossil fuels for the next 50 years, undermining our climate targets and make us dependent on the Azeri government. These revelations mean the EU must halt its support for this dangerous pipeline.\u201d",

        "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s attorney general pick, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, argued passionately that a Muslim ban needed to be an option, and publicly assailed the proposed ban\u2019s critics during a Senate committee hearing late last year.\nOn Dec. 10, 2015, Sessions broke with most of his Republican Senate Judiciary Committee colleagues to vote against an amendment stating that the Senate would not create policies that discriminate based on religion. Of the committee\u2019s 11 Republicans, 7\u2013\u2013including John Cornyn, Chuck Grassley, and Mike Lee\u2013\u2013voted for the amendment offer by Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy. But Sessions, joined by Ted Cruz and two other Republicans, voted against it.\nBut Sessions didn\u2019t stop there. The Alabama senator also gave a 30-minute speech to the committee room arguing that the federal government should be able to use whatever criteria it wants to decide who can and can\u2019t immigrate to the U.S.\u2013\u2013and that includes religion.\n\u201cThe adoption of the Leahy Amendment would constitute a transformation of our immigration system,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cIn effect, it is a move toward the ratification of the idea that global migration is a \u2018human right,\u2019 and a civil right, and that these so-called \u2018immigrants\u2019 rights\u2019 must be supreme to the rights of sovereign nations to determine who can and cannot enter their borders.\u201d\nHe also suggested that Leahy\u2019s amendment would increase the risk of terrorism by making it harder to keep out radicals.\n\u201cThis amendment would mean, for instance, that the United States could not favor for entry the moderate Muslim cleric over the radical Muslim cleric,\u201d he said.\nAnd, Sessions continued, it would make it harder to keep out people who could become terrorists after moving to the U.S.\n\u201cMany people are radicalized after they enter,\u201d the senator said. \u201cHow do we screen for that possibility, if we cannot even ask about an applicant's views on religion? Would we forbid questions about politics? Or theology?\u201d\nSessions concluded by intimating that Leahy\u2019s amendment could potentially be a step toward one-world government.\n\u201cIt goes beyond being unwise,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is reckless. It is absolute and without qualification. It could have pernicious impacts for decades, even centuries to come. It may be even a step from the concept of the nation-state to the idea of \u2018global citizenship.\u2019\u201d\nBreitbart lavished praise on Sessions for the speech\u2013\u2013which he had previewed that morning to Stephen Bannon (now a top Trump White House advisor) on Breitbart\u2019s SiriusXM radio show.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s appropriate to begin to discuss this,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cAnd he has forced that discussion. We may even have a discussion about it in Judiciary Committee today. But, you know, it\u2019s time for us to think this through. And the classical, internal American religious principles I don\u2019t think apply providing constitutional protections to persons not citizens who want to come here.\u201d\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

        "text": "National Public Radio likes to think it's about civility (not rudeness) and real news (not fake news). But when it comes to Donald Trump, on Friday night NPR became the promoter of a rude and disparaging joke on All Things Considered. Washington Post columnist and NPR contributor E. J. Dionne passed along a joke from unfunny leftist Andy Borowitz in The New Yorker: that Trump's picks were so contrary to the government's mission that next he would name Mexican drug kingpin \"El Chapo\" to run the DEA.\nDIONNE: Well, I think you've got Trump naming a lot of people who don't particularly seem to believe in the missions of their department. Scott Pruitt has been a great critic of the EPA, wants states to take over their work. The new labor secretary, Andrew Puzder, is from Hardee's and Carl's Jr. They employ a lot of low-wage labor. He's had regulatory issues with the Labor Department. This led to Andy Borowitz, the wonderful humor writer of The New Yorker, to write a mock news story saying that Trump had named Joaquin Guzman - the drug dealer, the drug kingpin El Chapo - to head the Drug Enforcement Administration. Now, yes, it's funny, but it does speak to the kinds of people that Trump is naming. This is an extremely conservative administration, way more conservative so far than George W.'s was.\nApparently, Saturday Night Live stole that joke and brought in Bryan Cranston to joke that Trump's DEA nominee was Walter White, the drug kingpin at the center of Breaking Bad. Liberals expect that everyone who serves in government must be a leftist. To them, the Department of Labor isn't about all working people, it's the Department of Unions. To them, the EPA is the Coal and Oil Bankrupting Administration.\nNPR anchor Ari Shapiro didn't even blink at the Trump-El Chapo smear. He just turned to David Brooks of The New York Times and asked: \"So David, how do you think Democrats, who have the minority in the Senate and yet are part of the confirmation process - how do you think they should approach these picks?\" This attack was so liberal that David Brooks actually disagreed with Dionne's arrogant position (don't faint):\nBROOKS: They may not be my cup of tea, but you know, it's not like they're against the mission of their agencies. All of these issues, whether it's labor issues, like the minimum wage or wage levels or environmental issues - there are tradeoffs. There are tradeoffs, say, between environmental costs and business costs. And Trump is clearly worried about growth, and he's picking people who are aggressively on the business costs and may be insensitive to the environmental costs. But it's not like they're against the agency - against the mission. It's just a different set of priorities. DIONNE: But I think the labor secretary poses a real problem. Here was a man who ran for president as the paladin of the working class. He was going to improve their wages. A, he couldn't even pick somebody at least from the manufacturing sector where he promised a revival. It's from the fast food sector. And so I think that one is a sort of a bigger problem for the long run given who voted for Donald Trump.\nBrooks disagreed again, that populists don't mind billionaires -- they voted for Trump. Brooks re-established his usual insider pose when Shapiro ended the week-in-review segment searching for eulogies for Joe Biden's political career:\nSHAPIRO: David, what do you think Biden's legacy will be? BROOKS: Well, people are skeptical and disgusted by Washington. But there are a lot of people like Joe Biden in it who - he was a genuinely good person. One of the things I find most remarkable about him is that so many politicians lose their inner voice, their sense of vocation. They become sort of public personas who are empty within. But Biden never lost the capacity for genuine emotion, which he showed, and genuine conscience, which he showed. And he remained a real person no matter how famous he got.\nHe \"remained a real person\" is apparently how you charitably describe his gaffe-a-minute performance.",

        "text": "There is no doubt that we have a problem in today\u2019s world. It\u2019s a big problem. The strange thing is that apparently we don\u2019t want to solve it, because we close our eyes to the problem and to its root cause. This closing of our eyes is officially endorsed by almost all governments in the world and is seen as politically correct. Naturally, there is no chance to improve things but it\u2019s likely to get much worse.\nThe problem is a faulty, black and white mind-set of a huge chunk of the world population and the root cause is what these people were taught to believe as the truth. The founders and subsequent authorities of those belief systems claimed that the Highest himself has revealed it. This was an ingenious way to prevent any criticism of the whole belief system, including those aspects of it which were against common sense.\nI have earlier written on how Christianity was the first to cleverly claim that God himself has given the full truth only to the Church and everyone must believe it at the cost of their lives. And Islam followed with a similar claim. Terrorism in the name of God started right then, by forcing \u201cthose who are wrong\u201d into the \u201cright\u201d faith or killing them. Millions of people were killed \u2013 from America to India and beyond. In history lessons, Christianity and Islam were mentioned together with communism, fascism and Nazism in having caused the maximum number of human beings murdered.\nIn primary school I learnt that Islam expanded through \u201cfire and sword\u201d. I remember this because \u2018Feuer und Schwert\u2019 was a meaningless phrase for me as a child. Only later, it dawned that it involved tremendous cruelty. This cruelty was not restricted to Islam. The Christian \u2018expansion\u2019 and the Inquisition were equally brutal.\nIn the 1970s when I was in University, we debated why religion has caused so much bloodshed. The debate was only on \u2018why\u2019 not on \u2018whether\u2019.\nIn 2000, a change in this approach became apparent. When the Pope John Paul II finally acknowledged the cruelty of the Inquisition, and publicly asked forgiveness from God, he did not blame the Church but \u2018sons and daughters of the Church\u2019 who committed \u2018mistakes\u2019. He tried to absolve the religion and laid the blame on \u2018misguided\u2019 followers.\nThis same pattern is followed today regarding Islam. When Jihadis attack innocent citizens shouting \u2018Allah ho Akbar\u2019, politicians and media are quick to declare that those terror acts have nothing to do with Islam but are the handiwork of misguided or deranged individuals.\nThe reaction is meanwhile so predictable. The standard version is:\nThe attack is shocking, revulsive, a cowardly act, but we stand united, won\u2019t allow another attack, won\u2019t be intimidated but continue with our lives, we won\u2019t let them win, etc\u2026\nThen Muslim representatives come on air stressing that they also condemn the attack. It is the act of a disturbed person, has nothing to do with Islam, there are 1,5 billion peaceful Muslims, which is proof of the peaceful nature of their religions, etc\u2026\nThen in major cities (provided the attack happened in the west) a landmark building is lit up in the colours of the country where the attack happened, candles are lit\u2026\nWe have gone through these motions far too often and there is something fake about it. The pain of those affected is real. Others may be grateful that it had not hit them \u2013 at least not this time. Yet those, who are supposed to protect us, are not honest.\nTrue, the attacks are shocking and revulsive, but they are not cowardly acts. The Jihadi kills because he is convinced that it is his duty to kill kafirs \u2013 and he is even ready to die in doing what he feels is right. This shows courage. All those terrorists are young. It is not normal, nor easy to risk one\u2019s life by killing others, unless he is absolutely convinced that the benefit is greater than the cost.\nAnd what does he expect as benefit?\nProbably he was taught already as a kid or has read it later on the internet that killing Kafirs pleases Allah. By doing so, he can make his life truly worthwhile, and he will be richly rewarded: he will have a better status in paradise than those who did not kill Kafirs.\nNow here is where we Kafirs are cowards. We don\u2019t dare to point to passages in the Quran, which support his expectation, for example Q 4.95 and ask what it means if not what is written there.\n*Those believers who stay at home \u2013 having no physical disability \u2013 are not equal to those who make Jihad in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their persons. Allah has granted a higher rank to those who make Jihad with their wealth and their persons than to those who stay at home. Though Allah has promised a good reward for all, Allah has prepared a much richer reward for those who make Jihad for Him than for those who stay at home. They have special higher ranks, forgiveness and mercy. Allah is forgiving, merciful\u201d (Q4. 95-96).\nImagine a pious, young, hot-headed Muslim reads this \u2013 would he not be inspired to make his life worthwhile? Even more so, if he has phantasies of becoming a hero with a gun? He probably considers dying as a small price for a greater glory. As Sultan Shahin pointed out, children in madrasas sing songs with the refrain \u201czindagi shuru hoti hai qubr mein\u201d (life starts in the grave). See link at the end.\nCuriously, old, sick Muslims don\u2019t seem to be interested in the \u201chigher status in paradise\u201d when it would make much more sense for them. Does it mean, they are more mature and know that the Quran must not be taken literally?\nIs it not their and our duty, to save not only the potential victims of future terror attacks but also the young Muslims who are ready to throw away their lives for a promise which may not be kept? After all, Christianity also claims that only those who are baptized can enter heaven.\nWe need to ask probing questions.\nThose must the question: why is it that in areas where Muslims have become the majority, the number of minorities keeps dwindling till they become almost non-existent? The Kashmir valley is a recent example.\nYes, it is difficult to believe that terror has anything to do with religion. Religion is understood to be something good. It connects us with the Highest and is meant to make us better human beings. We want to believe that the cause for terror is something else. \u2018All religions worship the same one God. No religion can possibly condone killing others\u2019, those of us who have not been brainwashed into a dogmatic religions, will naturally maintain. But is it true?\nWe need to find out. If we don\u2019t dare to do this, we are cowards.\nLet\u2019s imagine we come to the conclusion that indeed there are passages in the Islamic texts that condone terror against infidels, what will be the next step?\nThen we need to bring in common sense and reason and debate on the meaning of life and enquire into the absolute truth. India has the knowledge and must take the lead in this, because the Christian west is handicapped. Both, Islam and Christianity, divide humanity into \u2018us versus the rest\u2019, which results in a divisive mind-set. Instead, another dividing line must be drawn which Prime Minister Narendra Modi mentioned in one of his speeches: It is the line between humanity and inhumanity.\nTerror and hatred for other human beings is inhumanity. How do we know? Because we have a conscience which tells us what is right and what is wrong. This conscience must be the holy book for us. It is the voice of the Divine which guides us through life. If we listen to it, we realize that the whole of humanity is one family. The life in all of us comes from the same, most powerful yet invisible, source.\nIf somebody (including a religion) demands that we ignore our conscience and instead believe blindly what he tells us, he surely has an agenda. He wants sheep who don\u2019t think for themselves and who he can use for his own purpose.\nSuicide bombers are not cowards, but they are not smart. They got the purpose of life wrong.\nBy Maria Wirth\nVery informative: http://www.hinduhumanrights.info/reforming-islam-a-moderate-muslims-appeal-sultan-shahin/",

Lauren Tannehill \u0096 an avid shooter who had posted pictures of herself and her hubby target shooting on Twitter \u0096 just spaced out and\u00a0 didn't take the weapon with her, they said. But the blonde beauty\u00a0 -\u00a0 who was featured on HBO's reality sports series \"Hard Knocks\" \u0096 won't be charged with a crime. \"There is no crime. She just forgot,\" Karen Murphy, a spokeswoman for the Broward Sheriff's Office\u00a0 told The Post Thursday. Incredibly, the rental car company didn't find the weapon after the SUV was returned, and it was only discovered two days later by an upstate New York woman who was on a vacation with her daughter. The gun was legally registered to Ryan Tannehill, authorities added. Police did not say why Lauren, 26, was carrying the $2,000 weapon while driving the rented Nissan Rogue, but she is known as an avid shooter, and her Texas-born husband has often talked of his love of hunting. \"Don't mess with me,\" she wrote on Twitter beneath a\u00a0 photo of her target shooting in an open field with\u00a0 a handgun. \"Shooting together!\" she wrote on another photo of her and her husband \u0096 a former Texas A&M star she married last January \u0096 firing rifles during the same practice session. She rented the Nissan\u00a0 from E-Z Rent-A-Car on Jan. 4 and\u00a0 had the vehicle for about two hours before turning it in for another because it was too small. The same day,\u00a0 Judith Fleissig, 58, of Rochester rented the Rogue while visiting the area with her daughter Danielle Fleissig, a medical student who was interviewing for residencies at several Florida hospitals. Charlie Graham, a vice president for the Orlando-based E-Z Rent-A-Car, said cars are always cleaned between customers. \"That is part of our normal procedures. I'm not sure how that could get past,\" he told The Sun-Sentinel. Because someone obviously didn't do their job and clean the car out properly that's why. All rental places have video cameras all over the place so let's check the videotape.",

        "text": "Picking ETFs that try to beat the market. \"There's a place for active and passive investments,\" says Amy Schioldager, head of beta strategies at BlackRock. NEW YORK (Money Magazine) The fund industry writ large follows what's hot. And nothing is hotter now than trying to outsmart the market with an index fund. Look at buzzwords in the world of ETFs , which are nearly all index funds. From \"fundamental\" to \"smart beta\" to \"dynamic,\" they all point to the notion that there's a more clever way to index. Fundamental funds have been around since 2005. Their designers say there's a flaw in standard indexes: The greater a company's total market value, the bigger place it holds in an index. So when investors go gaga over Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) and drive up its price, an index fund must own more of it. Fundamental funds rank companies by other measures, such as sales and dividends. As a result, they lean, like Dimensional , toward value. But their creators argue that this may be more than compensation for risk. Rather, there's a chance to take advantage of behavioral biases, underweighting stocks the crowd loves too much. \"If you're contrarian, in the long run you can do better,\" says Jason Hsu of Research Affiliates, which built the index behind the $2.6 billion Power-Shares FTSE RAFI U.S. 1000 ETF ( PRF ) . The competition to create new indexes is getting stiffer. Among the entrants is BlackRock, a $4 trillion money manager that runs 7,000 different investment strategies. You may know the company better for its iShares brand of ETFs. BlackRock has since late 2011 launched 10 iShares funds offering some kind of enhanced index, and investors have poured in nearly $8 billion. BlackRock's biggest unit has roots (via acquisitions) in a company that in 1971 created the first indexed account for a pension fund. David Booth (LINK TK) worked on that fund. Two of BlackRock's new ETFs tilt based on the same small and value effects Dimensional goes after. But if Dimensional is akin to elegant, cultish Apple, iShares are like open-source Android. Since ETFs trade like stocks, they are available to anyone with a brokerage account, to combine in any way. \"There's a place for active and passive strategies,\" says Amy Schioldager, 51, BlackRock's head of beta strategies. (\"Beta\" is finance-speak for capturing the market's return.) BlackRock has found particular success with iShares MSCI USA Minimum Volatility ( USMV ) . It's built on research arguing that staid stocks, such as utilities with hefty dividends, may in the long run match or beat market returns without as much pain along the way. (A hypothetical version of the index the ETF follows would have earned 8.2% annualized over 10 years, vs. 7.2% for the S&P 500.) So-called low-volatility funds have had enormous appeal since the financial crisis. \"This is a great strategy for someone who's been a heavy bond user,\" says Schioldager, who adds that BlackRock launched the strategy at the request of institutional clients. At a time of measly bond yields, investors want other ways to capture income or reduce volatility. What to expect in the stock market in 2014. Some market watchers think low-vol stocks may be about to run out of steam. Money has poured into the space -- not just via indexers but from active funds too -- driving up valuations. \"It's always worrisome when a product becomes the darling of investors,\" says Morningstar analyst Samuel Lee. Will the low-vol investors stick around when performance fades? BlackRock says the company keeps funds open even when strategies go out of style. Schioldager says it isn't necessarily BlackRock's job to take sides in philosophical debates about investment strategies. The company aims to create cheap, well-designed tools. (Minimum Volatility charges 0.15%.) \"We offer building blocks,\" says Schioldager. The takeaway for you. As indexish strategies proliferate and advisers push the latest, greatest ways to do better, figuring out which theories hold water could be daunting. Getting this precisely right may not matter. Research Affiliates tabulated results for approaches including value tilt, a version of low volatility, holding stocks in equal proportions, and even monkeys throwing darts at the stock pages. Every one, (simulated) monkeys included, beat the market. Why? Almost any strategy other than ranking stocks by market value, as normal indexes do, tilts to small, value, or both, said RA. The upshot: Many of these funds may lag together when blue-chip growth stocks lead, and you shouldn't pay up just because a new index sounds sophisticated. If you buy an ETF with a twist, stick to the cheaper options. More fund managers' strategies: David Booth , chairman and co-CEO of Dimensional Fund Advisors Andrew Lo , professor of finance at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",

        "text": "Related. At the start of the Hero Hockey World League, India's hockey skipper Sardar Singh had promised his side wouldn't just make up the numbers but would surprise their opponents. Its unlikely anyone took him very seriously at the start of the tournament. After the first couple of defeats, one would be even less inclined to think so. The draw against Germany on Monday was perhaps the first time, there appeared to be some validity to the skipper's predictions. But on Wednesday, ten minutes into their game against defending world champions Australia and with a two goal to nothing lead, it is likely even Sardar would have been surprised. The match eventually finished 7-2 to the Australians, but at least for the first quarter of the game, India looked like pulling off the biggest upset of the tournament. The match had got off to a fast start. India had put together their first good opportunity in the opening minute of the game courtesy a move by K Uthappa and Mandeep Singh. But while the chance came to nothing, the lead eventually came in the sixth minute. Dharamvir Singh found space on the right, crossed to Birendra Lakra who shot on target from a tight angle. The goalbound attempt caught an Australian stick on the way to the net, but the umpires arms were pointing to the centerline all the same. Australia had a chance to pull things back when they earned a PC in the 9th minute, but PR Sreejesh cleared the high drag attempt. Australia would have known that India would come hard at them, but they still seemed unprepared for it. They made some surpringly basic errors including in the 10th minute when they left Yuvraj Walmiki unmarked on the left flank. That meant Nikkin Thimaiah on the right turned past a defender and fired a hit at the goalkeeper, Walmiki was able to tip the ball with a single hand on the stick to make the scoreline even more improbable. But the Australians aren't World champions for no reason. Their backs to the wall, Australia slowly took back control of the game. The Indians, meanwhile, much like an inexperienced runner who goes goes hard at the start of a marathon carried by adrenaline as much as anything, hit a wall. This one was quite literal, made up of massive Kookaburra defenders, who saw nothing in getting a bit physical where they needed to. Two minutes before that, the Australians had got on the scoreboard. Affan Yousuf was dispossesed on the frontline and a PC was earned on the counter. Nicholas Budgeon made sure of the chance with a straight low drag. Losing steam. The Indian defence unable to match the sustained pace of the Australians began to open up and in the 27th minute, Jason Wilson found himself unmarked next to the goal with a cross from 25 metres available. PR Sreejesh had left the goal two early and Wilson was able to dodge past him and level things. A few seconds from half time, India lost all advantage when Glen Turner flicked in a pass from the right flag area. India were fading fast and the break did nothing to revive them. Indeed the second half saw them completely outplayed. Russell Ford extended the lead to 4-2 in the 41st minute. Simon Orchard smashed home from the top of the corner to cap off a counter four minutes later. Ford made it 6-2 when he tapped in a short backpass from Turner. In between the carnage India had a couple of chances of their own. Walmiki only had Australia keeper between him and his second goal in the 48th minute but his shot was directed straight at the rushing Bazely's midsection. India earned a PC right after Walmiki's miss, but VR Raghunath's strike was wide. Australia rounded off the their scoreline when Joss Whedon pounced on a free hit deflection in the 65th minute. In other matches England set up a semifinal clash against Holland. England beat Belgium 1-0 while Netherlands edged a lacklustre Germany 2-1 in another quarterfinal. New Zealand recovered after captain Dean Couzins missed a penalty stroke to make the semis after beating Argentina in sudden death on penalties after their match ended 1-1.",

        "text": "Contently, a New York tech outfit that is emerging as a leader in the native advertising world, just landed $9 million in new funding from two venture capital firms \u0097 San Francisco-based Sigma West and Boston-based Sigma Prime Ventures, Media Ink has learned. \"Content marketing has proven to be a powerful approach for companies of all sizes, building their brands and awareness,\" said Sigma Prime's Paul Flanagan . Among Contently's clients are General Electric, American Express, Pepsi and, on the media side, Forbes and Gawker. Shane Snow, chief creative officer of Contently, said his company \"is a mix between two business models, a software technology company and a talent management company.\" Snow, along with CEO Joe Coleman, a boyhood friend from Idaho, and Chief Technology Officer Dave Goldberg, founded the company in 2010. About 80 percent of its revenue is derived from software and the other 20 percent comes from managing an extensive stable of writers \u0097 matching their editorial skills to advertisers looking to get a message across. Snow uses a network of more than 28,000 journalists to develop content. Of that number, he said, \"about 5,000\" are A-listers \u0097 drawn from top media companies which have been downsized or are simply looking to moonlight and earn extra income. Snow matches writers with brands and extracts a 15 percent fee. Generally writers are getting paid at the rate of around $1 a word. The company won't disclose its 2013 revenues, but Snow said they grew by 400 percent last year and he hopes to see them cross the $20 million barrier in 2014. Snow said that until recently, most of the expenditures for native advertising were coming out of public relations budgets, but more recently he noticed more of the funding coming out of traditional ad agency creative and marketing budgets. \"There is going to be a lot of market share stolen from banner ads,\" he predicts. Native advertising is contracted content written and designed not to look like the advertising it really is. The larger debate that will undoubtedly play out across the media world this year is whether branded advertising threatens or helps traditional media \u0097 magazines, newspapers, TV and radio networks. \"Right now this looks like a way for traditional publishers to make a premium on their page real estate,\" said Snow.",

        "text": "Six mutual fund houses \u0097 Axis , HDFC , ICICI Prudential , SBI , Kotak and Union KBC \u0097 have launched closed-ended debt-oriented hybrid funds investing in a mix of fixed income instruments and stocks in January. These closed-ended hybrid funds invest approximately 80% of the money in high quality bonds, which over a three-year period, ensure return of capital. The remaining 20% of the money is invested in stocks, which offer extra kicker to the returns. Some products come with a five-year term, too. Most market participants look at these products as means to generate a bit higher post-tax returns than fixed deposits. \"Closed-ended hybrid funds are good investment option for investors who need conservative exposure to equities and do not need liquidity,\" says Jignesh Harshadrai Shah, investment advisor of Capital Advisors. Though units of such schemes are listed on the stock exchange, they are rarely traded on the bourse. Investors typically get to exit at a steep discount to the prevailing net asset value of the scheme. In short, investors should be prepared to hold on to investments till the maturity of the scheme. Industry participants attribute the surge of such new fund offers to change in investors' preference and the current market scenario. \"Retail investors are demanding safer mutual fund products,\" says G Pradeepkumar, chief executive officer of Union KBC Asset Management Company. Investors are more comfortable with these hybrid funds because they offer protection against any huge downside at the end of the tenure of the scheme and a little exposure to equity would provide extra returns, he adds. \"Higher interest rates hovering in the range of 8-9% on three-year paper give scope for relatively higher exposure to equity of 20% in the current scenario in such funds,\" says Surajit Mishra,national head \u0097 mutual funds, Bajaj Capital . \"Such products in the past have generated post-tax returns of 6.1-12% in the past,\" he adds. However, the \"returns\" depend on the extent of exposure to equity and how equities perform during the period. \"Three years ago, the interest rates were lower than what they are today. That is why hybrid funds launched in those days are delivering low returns,\" says Mishra of Bajaj Capital. Low interest rate means that the fund manager has to put more money in fixed income instruments to ensure return of capital, leaving less allocation to equity. Also, the equity markets have not done well in the past three years. For example, CNX Nifty , the market bellwether index, delivered 2.31% in the three-year ended January 10. In fact, mutual funds are targeting investors who are keen to invest in equities but are afraid of losing money in the stock markets. However, everybody is not in favour of investing in hybrid funds. \"Many hybrid funds have not lived up to the returns expectations of the investors. Investors are better off building such a structure for themselves,\" says Abhinav Angirish, managing director of investonline. in \u0097 an online mutual fund distribution entity. He asks investors to invest in a good debt fund and diversified equity fund with a good long-term performance record in the ratio of 80:20 with a three-year time frame. Many experts also believe that closed-ended hybrid funds are not tax-efficient. Capital gains of these schemes are taxed as a debt fund \u0097 lower of 20.6% with indexation and 10.3% without indexation. If an investor invests in a combination of debt and equity schemes, only the debt fund is taxed and equity fund returns are tax free after one year.",

Mahender alias Ganja and Mohammed Raza were arrested late on Wednesday evening and produced before Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Sudhanshu Kaushik, who allowed the custodial interrogation of the duo till Janaury 20 after the police said their quizzing was necessary to apprehend six others involved in the crime. Investigators said eight accused, who are vagabonds, had allegedly gangraped and looted the Danish woman at knife-point on January 14 night.Delhi. \"\u0085since the recovery is to be affected and remaining co-accused are yet to be arrested, so the accused persons are remanded in police custody till January 20,\" the court said.

        "text": "Japan's ties with India do not target any country. They are solely intended to strengthen peace and stability in Asia. The national political mood is very febrile. The two big old parties had settled down to their usual battle on the secular/communalist border. Now there is a new kid on the block and the oldies are uncertain as to what the battle is about. But even so, they never miss an opportunity to miss the bus whenever the M (minority/Muslim) issue comes up. Something about the M issue makes their minds go numb and they settle into fixed positions whatever the facts. The recent news that the Lashkar-e-Toiba was found recruiting in Muzaffarnagar had one simple fact that could have been celebrated; namely that the LeT did not succeed in recruiting anyone. Local Muslims did not behave like cardboard characters in the way both the Congress and BJP have made them out to be. Rahul Gandhi had jumped the gun and given us a garbled version of the story. His aim was to point a\u00a0 finger at the BJP, which had allegedly fomented the riot and alienated local Muslims, so that they were soft targets for the LeT. Not to be left behind, the BJP is breathing fire about lapses in national security when all that has actually happened is that LeT operatives were caught thanks to the locals in UP. Rejoice! Pakistan's simplistic views about Indian Muslims are disproved. The Aam Aadmi Party has also fallen foul of not adopting the simplistic view of India which the older parties have. When it comes to Kashmir, the older parties have a schizophrenic view. Kashmir is an integral part of India but unlike any other part of India, no discussion is allowed about its people. Prashant Bhushan, who is not an ignoramus (as he has been portrayed), wondered whether the people of J&K had a view about the\u00a0 presence of the Army and AFSPA. This is a question over which Irom Sharmila has been fasting for many long years. We have reports that people living under AFSPA do not like it. Why can someone not raise such a question? Is India so touchy about Kashmir that it is beyond discussion? Why does the junior gang of the Sangh Parivar feel it necessary to vandalise the offices of AAP? Is this going to be a regular if the BJP comes to power? Let us hope not. But that may be why the old style of politics is looking so old. The older parties are still dealing with Partition. Both have problems about viewing Indians as Indians. Indians for them\u00a0 are Hindus, minorities or Muslims, and the nondescript rest who may be minorities but cannot be called so. Every Indian has to carry an identity which can then be treated to decide their vote bank as far as the oldies are concerned.",

That's not much better than the 29 percent national average, despite the numerous fitness and health initiatives launched during the Bloomberg Administration. Gotham's public high school students don't even measure up to their national counterparts, according to the 2011 Physical Activity survey released by the health agency. Only 50 percent of city teens were buffing and pumping up for the recommended three times weekly, which was lower than the 56 percent national average. \"Adults who engage in strength training are less likely to experience loss of muscle mass, functional decline, and fall-related injuries than adults who do not strength train.\" Males were more likely than females to pump iron \u0097 38 percent compared to 23 percent for adults and 58 percent to 42 percent among teens.

Only about one in five residents over 65 did strength exercises, compared to nearly one in three younger adults. Heath officials on Monday reported the number of elderly residents who ended up in hospital emergency rooms following slip and fall injuries increased 22 percent over five years. Gym members were more than twice as likely to meet the fitness guidelines. And teens who were members of sports teams were 50 percent more likely to be fit. Youths are expected to engage in at least 60 minutes of physical activity daily, whether it be through strength training or aerobics. The Health Department said Tuesday, \"Adults and teens across the country are not getting enough exercise and those in New York City are no exception, despite living in a relatively walkable city. Getting regular physical activity is one of the best ways for everyone to stay healthy. Teens need to get more aerobic exercise and muscle-strengthening exercise, and adults need to make it easier for them to do that.\"",

        "text": "Stocks, bonds? In 2014, think cash. While major turning points in the market only truly become clear in hindsight, look closely enough and you can start to make out the hazy shape of things to come. After a five-year rally that has more than doubled the value of the S&P 500, stock prices at least by one measure of valuation are among the frothiest in history. Speculation is back, as the use of borrowed money to invest is nearing pre-financial-crisis highs. And then there's the fact it's been nearly 2 1/2 years since stock prices fell significantly. Pullbacks of 10% or more typically occur at least once a year. Normally when faced with overheated equities, you can simply sell some winners and buy more bonds, either to get you back to your target allocation or to invest more conservatively. That strategy paid off big in the 2000-02 bear market, when the S&P 500 lost 47% while government bonds maturing over four to 10 years returned 26%. But what happens if both stocks and bonds are primed to deliver subpar returns? That appears to be the situation now. A big reason stocks have climbed so much is that the Federal Reserve has bought up more than $2 trillion in Treasury and mortgage bonds in recent years to try to boost growth by holding down long-term interest rates and thus promote risk taking. So-called quantitative easing has worked, but it has also driven fixed income prices up and yields down. Doug Ramsey, chief investment officer for the Leuthold Group, says, \"There's now joint overvaluation in U.S. stocks and bonds.\" The immediate concern: Now that the Fed has started shutting off its spigot in the face of an improving economy, the chances of rising interest rates prompting a selloff in stocks and bonds inevitably increase. Shortly after the Fed ended its two smaller rounds of quantitative easing -- in 2010 and 2011 -- the S&P 500 declined 16% and 19%, respectively. (Bond investors discounted QE's impact then, but lately they've shown they're convinced.) The bigger long-term worry: Above-average valuations mean the likelihood of disappointing returns over the next 10 years or so. What do you do? If you have decades to ride out the market's ups and downs, you don't have to do anything. 10 stock bets to make in 2014. But if retirement is closer than that, you want a strategy that offers some protection from a bad bear market and turns down the volatility in your portfolio at a time when you're unlikely to be richly rewarded for risk taking. Jason Brady, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management, notes: \"When the price of everything goes up, it stands to reason these investments become less attractive to own.\" In this article, you'll learn not only about moves you can make within your stock and bond holdings to cut risk but also about the importance of re-embracing a long-forgotten asset class -- cash. Stocks don't rise 150% every five years; bond prices don't soar when interest rates rise. So prepare for skimpier returns and higher risk. STOCKS: More expensive than you think. A popular way to tell if stocks are cheap or dear is to look at the market's price/earnings ratio using profit forecasts for the next 12 months. Based on this method, the S&P 500's P/E is 16, which is more than 15% higher than the market's long-run average. That's worrisome, but here's what's truly scary. If you calculate the market's P/E based not on projected profits but on 10 years of averaged earnings -- a more conservative and more reliably predictive method championed by Yale finance professor Robert Shiller -- the S&P 500's ratio is actually above 25. Over the past 130 years, there have been only a handful of periods in which the market's P/E has hit this level: 1901, 1928 to 1930, 1996 to 2002, and 2003 to 2007, just before the financial crisis. Each of those periods gave way to (or in the case of the irrational-exuberance era, included) a ferocious bear market. This note of caution isn't about making a short-term market call. Those periods also show that stocks can remain at frothy levels for years. In the current case, the S&P 500 just topped 25 in November. \"Sure, valuations can go higher from here,\" says Robert Arnott, chairman of the investment advisory firm Research Affiliates. \"But that's a game I choose not to play.\" That's because the long-term bet against the Shiller P/E is a loser. Since 1926, when the market's valuation has exceeded 25, the average inflation-adjusted annual return for stocks has been a mere 0.5% over the subsequent decade. (A five-year P/E calculated by the Leuthold Group yields a better, though still bad, result.) The average annual real return for stocks is about 7%. Freeman says quantitative easing, by lowering the cost of capital dramatically, has driven investors toward smaller companies that tend to be heavy borrowers. Thus far, that has worked out fine. Small-company stocks, which had been outpacing shares of large companies since 2000, got a second wind after the Fed's latest bond-buying program started in the fall of 2012. The problem is that valuations for small caps are way up. Historically, small stocks have traded at around the same P/E as blue chips, based on five years of average profits, according to the Leuthold Group. Today they're 25% more expensive. While small stocks outperform large ones over long periods, this isn't the time -- or the price -- to be buying up the little guys. Dial back your small-stock exposure, says Ramsey, by the amount they're overvalued -- say, 20% to 25%, and move that into blue chips. This is actually not a big step. Assuming you hold a fairly typical blend of mutual funds, for every $100 of your money invested in U.S. stocks, around $70 will be held in large-company shares and $30 in smaller names. A 25% reduction in this case works out to around an eight-percentage-point change. Then trim your stock allocation five percentage points or so from sectors that have directly and disproportionately gained from artificially low yields. Among them: real estate, which got a boost from record low borrowing costs, and high dividend-paying utilities, which were considered an alternative source of income in a low-rate world. If you own a REIT or utility fund through a 401(k) or IRA, selling won't trigger taxes. Own them in a taxable account, though, and you'll have choices to make. You can offset capital gains by selling some emerging-market holdings, which are largely down over the past three years. If you don't have losses and don't want a tax bill, you can start putting new money elsewhere. Move some money into foreign stocks. Sharon Hill, a portfolio manager with Delaware Investments, says relative to the U.S., foreign equities are downright attractively priced. Global stocks are selling at a 20% discount to domestic shares, even though historically they've traded on par with U.S. securities. So shifting out of U.S. stocks and into the broad foreign markets is a sound way to reduce risk, she says. But do so within reason. Vanguard studied the usefulness of foreign stocks and found something interesting: While adding international exposure gradually reduces volatility in your portfolio, the diversification benefit starts to dissipate once your overseas weighting jumps above around 40%. If you have only minimal international exposure, shift five to 10 percentage points toward overseas holdings using a broad-based fund such as Vanguard Total International Stock ( VGTSX ) or Dodge & Cox International Stock ( DODFX ) , both in the MONEY 50. If you already keep more than a third of your equities abroad, go up to 40% but no more. BONDS: This time they're not a safe bet. Look back over the major bear markets for stocks, and in almost every case bonds did an admirable job of limiting the damage. On several occasions, in fact, fixed income delivered double-digit gains. Yet with market interest rates at such low levels thanks to Fed policy, it's hard to imagine that bonds can offer you that kind of shelter this time. Bull markets in stocks are usually killed by rising interest rates, which also crimp bond prices. In the past, however, bond yields were high enough to compensate you for the drop in value. For example, when the Fed lifted rates in 1973, which helped trigger the equity bear market of 1973-74, 10-year Treasury notes were yielding over 7%. So even though bond prices fell that year, intermediate government bonds returned nearly 5%. Today the math simply doesn't work. If the 10-year note's interest rate was to rise by one percentage point, a broad-market bond fund would probably lose about 6% of its value. Tack on a yield of less than 3%, and you're losing money. That's pretty much what happened last year when investors feared the Fed would start to taper its bond-buying program. And the average long-term government bond fund, which is very sensitive to interest rates, racked up a 12% loss. It's not just short-term returns you have to worry about. The Leuthold Group studied the historical performance of bonds and found that there is a simple rule of thumb: Whatever the yield on 10-year Treasuries currently is, that's about the annual total return you can expect from bonds over the next decade. Today that yield is a historically low 2.8%. That's around half the average return for bonds. Your best moves. Lend less to Uncle Sam. You can diminish risks in your bond portfolio by taking 20% to 25% of your exposure to funds with big stakes in U.S. government debt and shifting that money into other segments of fixed income. For instance, yields on municipal bonds look relatively attractive -- especially since the improving economy is strengthening state and city finances. So, too, do high-quality corporate bonds. Don't buy a lot of junk. Just be careful with higher-yielding securities, such as junk bonds, strategists say. When yields are low, investors tend to plow money into higher-paying stuff. But eventually all that buying drives yields down, as we've seen in the past year. Now you're often not being paid enough for the extra credit risk you're taking, except possibly with debtors classified just slightly below investment grade. It's not just the higher possibility of default that's a problem. \"You take on a different level of risk that's more highly correlated with stocks,\" says Mary Ellen Stanek, director of asset management for Baird. Indeed, U.S. government bonds often go up when stocks go down. Junk historically moves more or less in sync with equities. \"At the end of the day,\" Stanek says, \"you want your bond portfolio to truly behave like a bond portfolio when it most needs to.\" CASH: Bulk up on a forgotten asset. Before the Federal Reserve under Alan Greenspan hammered interest rates into the ground starting in the 1990s, cash was a part of many prudent investors' portfolios. A savings account or money-market fund lowered portfolio volatility, provided income, and allowed holders to scoop up bargains when stocks fell. Given today's stock and bond valuations and the fact that interest rates are bound to rise, \"there's nothing wrong with pulling 10% off the table and sitting in cash,\" says James Stack, a market historian and editor of the InvesTech Research newsletter. This is especially true, he says, for investors who are within 10 to 15 years of retirement or are already retired. Younger investors with more time to recover from subpar returns don't have to play as much defense. But, Stack says, they may choose to go to cash to be opportunistic -- to jump on stocks once prices fall substantially. Greg Schultz, a principal with Asset Allocation Advisors, thinks you can go even higher -- to around 15% cash, by reducing both stock and bond holdings. That may sound radical, but even at today's depressing cash yields, many successful portfolio managers keep 5% to 10% of their assets in cash when they can't find attractively priced investments to buy. And there are plenty of things that a stash of cash can do for you. Your best moves. You'll turn paper profits into actual ones. Since selling winners will trigger capital gains taxes, do it in your tax-sheltered 401(k)s and IRAs as part of your rebalancing, along with the stock and bond moves suggested above. Alternatively, you can simply start putting money into an online-only bank savings account that now pays close to 1% interest and build up a position during the year. You can hedge your bond holdings. In a rising interest rate environment, cash will progressively gain value at the same time as some of your bonds are apt to lose ground. You'll still be in the game. Even if the stock market continues to climb, having a 10% stake in cash won't prevent you from taking part in the gains. A balanced portfolio with a 60% stock/40% bond allocation, for instance, returned 15.3% last year. Had you shifted that to a 55% stock/35% bond/10% cash allocation, you'd have earned one point less. And you will stay strong. Because cash will cut losses and volatility, it just might help you stay the course in the rest of your portfolio, says Schultz. \"Yes, there's an opportunity cost, but common sense tells you that if things are richly priced today, there will come a time when they will be cheaper,\" he says. Money in the bank will help you handle the selloff while positioning yourself for the eventual rebound.",

        "text": "It's one of the sad ironies of modern life that as marriage has grown more idealized, it's also becoming less common. The amount we spend on weddings has skyrocketed; American women are glued to shows about buying the perfect wedding dress, finding the most delicious food to serve at the reception and hiring the best band. Yet we're less and less likely to actually tie the knot. Even when kids are involved: New data from the government's National Survey of Family Growth shows that 40 percent of all births during the 2000s were to unwed mothers. And that last isn't only due to the fact that we have stopped stigmatizing pre-marital sex and out-of-wedlock births: It's also the way we've started thinking of marriage as a consumer good, rather than a transcendental commitment that allows the couple to work at building a better, more meaningful life. Many now see marriage as a prize that you win for getting your life together. Interviews with American women reveal that they want to wait until they get an education, a decent job, good financial footing, even a downpayment on a home before they'll take that next step of getting married. And who can blame them? If you don't have an extra few grand to spend to \"look like a princess\" on your \"big day\" and \u0097 if you've watched a few episodes of \"Say Yes to the Dress\" \u0097 you'll conclude it's probably not worth it. Which is why the decline in marriage can be seen most dramatically among poor Americans. A 2010 Pew survey found that 64 percent of college-educated Amer\u00adicans get married, compared with only 48 percent of those with a high-school diploma or less. That gap quadrupled in the half century after 1960. Poor women still dream of the fairy-tale wedding, but few believe they can afford it. If you'll excuse a little cheesiness, though, marriage is supposed to be a journey, not a destination. Or rather, it's best thought of as a tool to help you on your journey. The data are clear on this point. Marriage has lots of benefits, but the easiest to measure are financial. All things being equal, it's much easier to make it on two incomes than one (or at least, if one spouse stays home with the kids, two workers). And the long-term commitment of marriage means that people are more likely to pool their resources and build a life together \u0097 even if you got the ring from a Cracker Jack box and spoke your vows at City Hall. But like any tool, there is a correct way to use marriage. Which brings us to a recent study from the Council on Contemporary Families. The CCF researchers found that these financial benefits don't necessarily show when a single mother marries: \"We found no physical or psychological advantages for the majority of adolescents born to a single mother whose mothers later married.\" They did, however, find a \"modest benefit\" for the children whose mothers married the biological fathers. This is pretty logical. As Brad Wilcox of the National Marriage Project explains, the \"new guy may not be particularly invested in a child who is not his.\" A huge mound of studies support the idea that it is best for a child to be raised by two biological parents. And when that possibility isn't available, there is no clear advantage to having a stepfather over growing up with a single parent. The implications of the new CCF study and the other research seem clear enough: To get the benefits of marriage, you should marry first, then have children with the guy you marry. But such a conclusion is apparently too old-fashioned for the folks at CCF, who argue that the government should stop its encouragement of marriage as a way to get out of poverty. Kristi Williams, a sociologist at Ohio University and lead author of the study, says poverty is the reason people don't marry. And rationally so, she suggests: If you're poor, she tells me, \"the men available to you have low levels of education and few good economic prospects.\" Then again, by that logic, why have a baby with such a guy? Williams insists we must fix poverty first, then we can fix marriage. To fix poverty, she suggests \"raising the minimum wage\" and \"offering more sex education and more access to birth control and family planning.\" Let's leave aside whether those fixes are likely to change anything \u0097 as well her suggestion that these women are too ignorant to know how not to get pregnant and that they can't afford (now free) birth-control pills. The problem is that Williams accepts the idea that the institution of marriage should be the cherry on top once everything else in life is settled \u0097 a notion that's better suited for reality TV.",

        "text": "Military advocates are still outraged , because the vast majority of veterans will still lose some pension benefits. \"That's probably the most egregious part of a very egregious provision,\" said Army Col. Michael Barron, who retired four years ago, after 30 years of service. He was deployed to Iraq during both wars and also faces a cut. \"We want them to remove the entire provision, not just one teeny component of it,\" said Barron, who is also deputy director of government relations for the Military Officers Association of America. Most military retirees are a lot younger than private sector retirees . They enlist in their 20's and retire in their 40's. Very few stay on until they reach 62 -- those who may be lucky enough to escape major injuries at war, or rose to higher echelons in the military system. When compounded, the 1 percentage point cut could result in much more than a 20% reduction in retiree pensions over 20 years. The average cut in pension payouts, including compounding interest, for a retiring Army Sergeant first class, would be about $3,700 each year, according to the Military Officers Association of America. Over 20 years, the total losses could balloon to more than $80,000. Military retirees continue to lobby hard to reinstate cost-of-living increases for all. They have the support of a key group of eight Senate Republicans. The lawmakers might be able to repeal the military cuts in exchange for a deal with Democrats on extending jobless benefits extended for the long-term unemployed . For now, negotiations continue.",

        "text": "What music videos were to the MTV of yore, programs about single teen mothers are to the MTV of today \u0097 a staple. The network's franchise of reality shows about teenagers coping with out-of-wedlock-births, beginning with \"16 and Pregnant\" and including the spinoffs \"Teen Mom\" and \"Teen Mom 2,\" has been a runaway success. It has given us such teen moms as Jenelle Evans, who alleged that her drug-abusing boyfriend beat her up, causing her to have a miscarriage. And Amber Portwood, who got out of jail on parole last year after serving time for drug charges \u0097 the latest in a string of troubles encompassing a suicide attempt and battery charges for allegedly beating up her boyfriend. And, of course, Farrah Abraham. If you don't know who Abraham is, you obviously haven't been keeping up with Us Weekly. She didn't tell her ex-boyfriend that he was the father before he was killed in a car accident. Her mother was charged with assault for hitting her. But never mind. Rocketed to D-list celebrity by her appearances on \"16 and Pregnant\" and \"Teen Mom,\" she got two breast augmentations, performed in a sex video and has now graduated to appearing on the VH1 show \"Couples Therapy.\" In other words, she is living the American Dream of pointless notoriety. For understandable reasons, the MTV franchise has been lambasted by cultural conservatives for glamorizing the lives of young women who have made desperately poor choices. But along come a couple of economists with a new paper on the social effects of the MTV shows to tell us that that gets it all wrong: The programs actually led, by their calculations, to a nearly 6 percent reduction in the teen birthrate between June 2009 and the end of 2010. Their analysis of all the episodes of \"16 and Pregnant\" finds 47 pregnancies, and only four marriages prior to birth. Almost all the fathers stay involved throughout the pregnancy, but by the end of the episodes, half the relationships are very strained or over. About a quarter of the births are by C-section, and the young mothers experience \"extensive sleep deprivation.\" This is not \"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous\" or \"The Bachelorette.\" \"Overall,\" write the authors of the study, Melissa Kearney of the University of Maryland and Phillip Levine of Wellesley College, \"the realities of the lives of teen mothers are presented in ways that may have been unknown or difficult to imagine for other teens viewing the show.\" According to their findings, getting a dose of the reality of teen child rearing \u0097 which means limited educational prospects and a high likelihood of poverty \u0097 changes the behavior of teens exposed to the shows. There are two things to say about this result. One is that it vindicates the common-sensical belief that pop culture has an impact on how we live. The entertainment industry celebrates itself as important and brave, but when anyone suggests that its stupid and degrading output might influence how anyone thinks or behaves, it retreats to the \"it's just a TV show or movie\" defense. The other is that the trend toward ever-increasing out-of-wedlock child rearing needn't be accepted as inevitable. If MTV has inadvertently stumbled on a highly credible way to make the case to teens that the life of a single teen parent is to be avoided, then surely there are other effective ways to spread the word about the struggles inherent to out-of-wedlock child rearing more generally. (Teens under 18 account for less than 8 percent of all out-of-wedlock births.) As for MTV, it may create a mixed message. Another new study found that teenage viewers of the shows had unrealistically rosy views of single motherhood \u0097 perhaps because after the travails depicted on \"16 and Pregnant,\" a few high-profile teen moms like Farrah Abraham graduate to the tawdry satisfactions of minor celebrityhood. It's safe to assume that nothing good comes from MTV, except by accident.",

        "text": "MUMBAI: The banking sector, which will see the entry of new players this year, is witnessing a hectic pace of activity on the HR front. An unusually high percentage of hiring is taking place, which is being attributed not only to branch expansion by existing banks but also to the new banking licences that are expected to be issued. Experts believe this could lead to a war for talent. Prospective players are said to be researching employee databases in existing banks to identify talent. Some are believed to have even kept banking personnel on a standby so that they can hit the ground running, if and when they bag a licence. With the fear of being poached by new players, existing banks, on the other hand, are boosting their strength and using innovative employee retention tools. Some could even look at golden handcuffs, if faced with a loss of talent, industry sources said. \"The banking sector where the hiring rate was not more than 15-20% in 2012-13, has witnessed a spurt in hiring of around 60% till December last year. Most of the existing banks are gearing up by increasing their headcount in order to stay ahead. We expect the trend to continue and grow stronger,\" said Ajay Shah, general manager (BFSI), TeamLease Services, a staffing company. \"Companies/financial services firms aspiring for a banking licence are putting in place a database of people for senior positions (CXO/CXO-1 levels) that will form the core team. Given their established credentials of having built businesses from ground up, key people in Indian private banks are likely to be prime targets for the new entrants,\" said Animesh Kumar, group head, HR & corporate services, IDFC. Firms which bag banking licences would get about 18 months to launch operations. To cut down on cycle times and costs, technology, big data and analytics will be key drivers of new ways of acquiring talent and delivering services and products. \"An important source of talent for prospective banking firms would be women managers, especially those who have taken a career break and are now desirous of coming back into formal employment,\" said IDFC's Kumar. Another interesting talent pool for banking aspirants, he said, is likely to be the Indian diaspora, which is now looking to relocate back to India for personal reasons. Santrupt Misra, group HR head, Aditya Birla Group, however, said, the group is not hiring for banking. \"It will be presumptuous on our part to do so as the licence issue is not decided,\" he said. The group is not worried given its strong employer brand. \"Should we get a licence, we will take up hiring. Some companies may have done opportunity hiring or may be meeting other needs that are current hoping to leverage when the bank comes up,\" said Misra. While private banks are worried about the HR challenge, they too are sprucing up their strength. Axis Bank , for instance, is expected to see a double-digit headcount growth this year. The bank is tapping on growth potential at unbanked locations. \"Hiring is primarily towards the expansion plan of the bank. The new banking licences would have an impact few years later,\" said Rajesh Dahiya, president-HR, Axis Bank, who is hopeful that its employee engagement initiatives and growth opportunities within the bank would help retain key talent. Ratnakar Bank , on the other hand, is expected to close the year (March 31, 2014) with 1,000 hires this year to take its total strength of 2,600 employees. \"The way plans are being discussed, we will continue to hire around 500 or so even in the next year, but it is not finalized yet,\" said Tajinder Kumar, head-HR, Ratnakar Bank. Kumar admits shortage of talent is a challenge for the sector. \"Existing private banks, other banks and even public sector banks have stepped up hiring efforts in a big way. When new banks come up, although one is not clear on date and count, they will also have a requirement of senior management people,\" he said. So is it an unusual trend? \"It seems to be a period of significant change in the sector. Technology is playing a very important role in this change, so is operations and sales and distribution . Newer ways of work require different skills, so re-skilling is key,\" said Ratnakar Bank's Kumar. Even customer expectations have changed. If you look at how banking was done 10 years back and now, there is a vast difference.",

        "text": "Mayor Bloomberg has donned a hardhat countless times as he framed his greatest legacy: the city itself. Photo: NY Post composite. New York City comprises five very different boroughs, but Michael Bloomberg dreamed of a single, shimmering metropolis \u0097 one of skyscrapers where none stood before; of desolate neighborhoods brought back to life; of moribund waterfronts teeming anew; and of a magical park on a trestle where steam locomotives once delivered beef and grain. In 12 years, he made much of his vision a reality. \"The Bloomberg legacy is going to be part of New York for the next 50 years because he changed the physical landscape,\" says NYU urban policy and planning authority Mitchell Moss. \"So much of our land was undervalued, and he gave it value.\" That he accomplished it despite the catastrophic economic impact of 9/11, the 2008 Wall Street crash and Hurricane Sandy makes it more remarkable. Unlike Robert Moses, Bloomberg didn't bulldoze homes. But he wielded a ruthless hand on the levers of mayoral clout, tempered by more respect for the way New Yorkers live, work and play than his numbers-driven techno-speak might suggest. He brought no particular urban-planning ideology, but only common sense, to the task of remaking New York for the 21st century. Yet it was ferocious common sense, reinforced by a steel will and a $25 billion personal fortune, which freed him from placating special interests. It will take years, if not generations, to fully perceive what the whirlwind wrought. This is not merely because the changes are many and vast to how neighborhoods and the communities they serve function. The larger imponderable is: How will all the pieces of the puzzle fit together as part of the new urban fabric? By now, Bloomberg's credits can sound like old news: nearly 40 percent of city land rezoned, often (although far from always) to allow larger new buildings. Since 2001, 40,000 new structures, 170,000 new housing units, 450 miles of bike lanes, nearly 1,000 acres of new parks. Or forget statistics and use your eyes. Stand in the middle of Columbus Circle, once a traffic nightmare and camp for the homeless. Time Warner Center was under way before Bloomberg took office, but everything else owes its existence or pristine condition to his administration. The sparkling Museum of Arts & Design came into being when the city sold off crumbling 2 Columbus Circle. The streamlined traffic flow and landscaped oasis in the circle's once-forbidding center are a product of the Department of Transportation and other agencies. The radiant restoration of Art Deco 240 Central Park South by its owners followed its 2002 designation as a protected city landmark. Bloomberg had made his fortune on Wall Street and in technology, and understood those businesses as none of his predecessors did. He had no sentimental attachment to abandoned \"manufacturing\" districts. Yet City Hall had allowed precious parcels of all five boroughs to remain zoned as if we were still the factory town of 1950. Bloomberg's 120 different rezoning measures brought forth new hotels in the dying West 30s, modest commercial regeneration in the Bronx, and modern apartment buildings along the desolate Williamsburg, Greenpoint and Long Island City waterfronts. His Economic Development Corporation built the great High Line Park. Bloomberg utilized tax benefits and \u00a0 infrastructure investment to get two mighty \u00a0 endeavors off the ground: Hudson Yards, where an 80-story office tower is under way for Coach Inc. and L'Oreal, and Atlantic Yards, where Barclays Center\u00a0 symbolizes the \"new\" Brooklyn. Not every Bloomberg action clicked right out of the gate. Brooklyn's Fourth Avenue, a backwater of auto repair shops, was rezoned in 2003 to allow new apartment buildings up to 12 stories tall. But the measure neglected to require them to include retail uses. Then the recession stalled some projects before they got off the ground \u0097 yielding a staccato procession of boxy, charmless new structures without stores or cafes. Yet those buildings quickly filled with residents. The city later fine-tuned the zoning to include stores and restaurants, and the delayed ventures are roaring back to life. In Times Square, too, Bloomberg secured the territory first and left the fine points for later. However popular with tourists, the asphalt pedestrian plazas are unworthy of their iconic location. But a $45 million redesign to replace their schoolyard surfaces with twinkling, light-reflective concrete will make all the difference, judging by the first stage now under way. Yet, while Bloomberg opened up many precincts to growth, he severely inhibited it in others. This is a less recognized part of his legacy. He imposed fresh limits on construction in more low-rise residential neighborhoods than he up-zoned, from Williamsbridge/Baychester in the Bronx to remote corners of the Rockaways. Preserving districts where dramatic transformation surely would otherwise have occurred is itself a kind of transformation. Bloomberg's Landmarks Commission established 32 percent more historic districts \u0097 where the panel micro-manages what may be built \u0097 than existed before. On the Upper West Side and in the West Village, nearly 70 percent of all buildings are now covered by individual landmark or historic-district protection. Bloomberg the tower- and condo-builder was also the greatest preservationist of them all. Will the appeal of waterfront living in Williamsburg and Hunters Point diminish the desirability of those neighborhoods' traditional dwelling grounds? Will the\u00a0 \"Skyscraper Historic District\" on Brooklyn's Court Street, which preserved a bunch of weathered old office buildings, prove a boon or a blight to neighboring brownstone communities? Also, Bloomberg left one piece of crucial unfinished business: his aborted attempt to rezone East Midtown, a \"premier\" but increasingly obsolescent office district astride Park Avenue where buildings average 70 years old. He waited until it was too late. So it was cut down in a buzzsaw of \"community\" resistance over density and infrastructure. But that rare blunder will likely be remedied by Bill de Blasio or his successor. The myriad gifts Bloomberg bestowed on the cityscape will be remembered more than the one he couldn't quite deliver. The new New York he made, from Riverdale to Coney Island, is just being born \u0097 a hint of the full-blown Bloombubble which our children, and our children's children, will behold. FIDI. Photo: EPA. The mayor got off to a weak start in Lower Manhattan, at first objecting to commercial reconstruction and ceding control of the area post-9/11 to then-Gov. George Pataki. But one of his first steps in office was crucial: He killed the NYSE's plan for a 60-story tower in the middle of Wall Street, a project which made no sense in the digital age. That signal from City Hall helped open up FiDi to its residential boom. In 2006, Bloomberg brokered a deal between the Port Authority and Larry Silverstein over new World Trade Center towers that finally allowed major construction to start. He rescued the faltering Memorial with his own funds and by twisting bankers' arms to pony up as well. City incentives lured a swelling tide of technology companies to older office buildings.

In LIC's Hunter's Point section, Bloomberg created an entirely new neighborhood along the post-industrial East River waterfront \u0097 one of several he set in motion in Brooklyn and Queens. The Economic Development Corp. in 2012 opened the Hunter's Point South Waterfront Park, a five-acre open space on the full 30-acre site that will eventually boast 5,000 new apartments, 60 percent of them \"affordable.\" The city spent $66 million to build the park and related infrastructure.

Bloomberg spared the crumbling old train trestle from demolition (for which permits had been issued) and in 2002 embraced the idea of turning it into a park. The city paid most of its $152 million construction cost and built it. In 2005, Bloomberg rezoned neighboring West Chelsea to exploit the park's magnetic pull years before it was opened. The moves catalyzed well over $20 billion in new development, much of it in architecturally compelling apartment buildings but also in dramatic adaptive re-uses, such as the Avenues World School in a former grocery warehouse.

Bloomberg was instrumental in creating the public-private partnership behind this 85-acre jewel of greenery at the foot of the bridge and the edge of the thriving and growing Dumbo neighborhood. When completed, it will stretch from the foot of Atlantic Avenue to the Manhattan Bridge. The city contributed about half of the $350 million for infrastructure upgrades on rotting piers and lawns. Bloomberg also stimulated private-sector apartment and hotel projects nearby that will help pay for the park's upkeep and security. BARCLAYS CENTER. Photo: Getty Images. Although state condemnation was the prime mover behind Atlantic Yards, the city played a prominent role as well. Bloomberg gave a generous tax subsidy to developer Bruce Ratner. He lent the prestige of his office to the controversial project, which had to overcome years of lawsuits. Rezoning of several neighborhoods around the sports and entertainment mecca liberated them from decades of neglect. Barclays' arrival inspired a store and restaurant boom on all sides. The world's tallest prefab apartment tower, now rising behind the arena, is being assembled at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, the former shipbuilding complex that's now a thriving industrial park thanks to massive city investment under Bloomberg.

Rising 625 feet over the St. George waterfront, the elegant, lacy structure would be the world's tallest Ferris wheel. Scheduled to break ground in 2014 and open in 2016, it's part of a planned $580 million complex near the ferry terminal to also include a 350,000-square-foot Empire Outlets shopping mall. Both projects received all city approvals. However, the state last week declined to provide an economic development grant to the Wheel, which has a different development team than the Outlets. It wasn't clear what effect, if any, that decision would have.",

        "text": "MORE ON: It now looks like ObamaCare will hurt twice as many people as it helps \u0097 because the law isn't nearly done with canceling people's insurance. The 5 million-plus Americans who've seen their health plans canceled thanks to ObamaCare will be joined by millions more this year \u0097 because the Affordable Care Act makes their employer-provided policies illegal, as well. ObamaCare defenders are trying to minimize the coming pain. Jonathan Gruber, an architect of the law, told The Washington Post that the number of \"losers\" who will have to pay more for the same or inferior coverage will be \"very, very small.\" Nonsense. ObamaCare exchange plans \u0097 the only option for most people who lose on-the-job coverage \u0097 are a raw deal. Yet millions will get dropped from employer-provided coverage over the course of this year and be stuck with that alternative. Effective Jan. 1 of this year, the Affordable Care Act requires small-group plans to provide 10 \"essential benefits.\" Many employers renewed their plans late last year to avoid that costly requirement as long as possible. But as the months pass, these plans will expire \u0097 and employers will be tempted to drop coverage altogether, rather than pay for those costly added benefits. And those dropped employees will be stuck with ObamaCare-exchange plans or no insurance at all. Yet an exchange plan is a ripoff compared with what they're losing. On average, US workers with on-the-job individual coverage contribute $999 a year in pre-tax dollars and have a deductible of $1,135, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. On ObamaCare exchanges, all but the lowest earners will pay more (even after subsidies), pay with after-tax dollars, face deductibles of $3,000 to $5,000 for silver and bronze plans and lose access to many doctors and hospitals they're covered for now. How many people will this change clobber? Well, about 60 million Americans now get employer-provided insurance via small-group plans. Law firms and other high-end businesses are unlikely to drop coverage, but companies with lots of salespeople, receptionists and other lower-paid workers will say they can't afford Washington's \"one size fits all\" requirement \u0097 which, the Heritage Foundation reports, adds an estimated $1.79 an hour to the cost of a 40-hour worker (and more than $2 an hour in states like New York and New Jersey, where health care is more expensive). Even the chance that ObamaCare's \"employer mandate\" will go into effect in 2015 isn't apt to deter employers from dropping coverage. The penalty for not complying with the mandate would add only 98 cents an hour for a 40-hour worker \u0097 a bargain compared with the $1.79 cost of providing coverage plus the enormous amount of red tape, reporting requirements and fees that ObamaCare piles on employers who provide coverage. In truth, the law discourages employers from insuring their workers, making it far easier and cheaper to send them to the exchanges. That's why the management consultants at McKinsey & Co. warned in 2011 that nearly a third of employers surveyed already were considering dropping coverage, with the figure rising among those familiar with the law's requirements. So a conservative estimate is that 25 million people, out of the 60 million in small group plans, get dropped in 2014. Add that to the 5 million or so whose individual-market already canceled on Jan. 1, and you have a lot of losers. Indeed, it looks like ObamaCare will create twice as many losers as winners in 2014. The Congressional Budget Office projects that 16 million will gain coverage via the law's Medicaid expansion (9 million) and subsidized exchange plans (7 million) \u0097 and even that's rosier than the enrollment figures we've seen so far. Thirty million losing insurance; 16 million gaining it. It'll be hard for Democrats running for election this fall to defend a law that hurts twice as many people as it helps.",

        "text": "There is no question about it \u0097 land prices are up and that is causing some angst to bankers as they add up just how much money they can lend on a deal. \"We are looking at the cost basis, and we have to agree with that value,\" explained Jenna Gerstenlauer, founder and managing partner of Sound Mark Partners. \"If someone is buying a building and paying several hundred dollars a foot and knocking it down, it adds to your cost.\" Sound Mark, based in Greenwich, Conn., is raising funds and then investing in debt in mortgages. \"The deals that make the most sense,\" she added, \"are where they acquired the deal in last five years \u0097 those tend to work.\" A year ago they closed a transaction where the pro-forma for the future residential condominium sales was $2,000 a foot. They got comfortable with the numbers and later sales came in at $2,500 to $3,000 a foot. \"It's a granular analysis,\" she said. \"You have to know the buyer\" \u0097 that is, the developer/sponsor of the condominium site. She also frowns on potential borrowers who provide an analysis that predicts the sales three years later at numbers never before achieved. \"You want a mix of units and want it affordable so that you are not counting on the 1 percent of the 1 percent to be the buyers,\" Gerstenlauer explained. \"For a builder, you need to sell them, and if you are long with seven units selling for $7 million each, you have a problem.\" At a Crain's forum in November, Alan Wiener, managing director at Wells Fargo remarked, \"We forget what happened four and five years ago. I scratch my head about rating agencies and what they didn't learn.\" He said Wells Fargo has to price competitively, and because of the size of the deals, they sometimes have to be syndicated. \"We will do loans up to $150 million so we will have to syndicate to button them up,\" he said. \"They have to have reasonable returns to make sure other banks will come in and do business with you.\" The chief investment officer for developer Taconic Partners, Kevin Davis, said at the same forum that construction loans require recourse \u0097 which means if the developer defaults, someone's piggy bank could be on the line. For a $300 million project with $200 million in debt, the lender will require a lot of equity and a repayment guarantee. \"If we can't pay it back you have to go into our personal checkbooks,\" Davis said. Ari J. Hirt, Director in the Debt & Equity Finance Group at Mission Capital Advisors, said the company arranges financial partners that could be institutional investors, such as opportunity or pension funds, or even families with cash, to provide the debt and equity needed by his client developers. He says CMBS lenders are now very active and have become more aggressive in locking down deals in New York. \"You can get 70 to 75 percent LTV,\" he said of the loan-to-value ratio. \"Clients are coming to us because we are out in the market and can find the right lender for the right deal,\" Hirt said. Their TriBeCa office has no walls and is set up \"like a newspaper office\" so employees can cross-pollinate to make matches \u0097 such as bringing in new banks to the city. But it is hard to forecast ahead because there are so many variables. \"We just hope interest rates are low and the world situation remains stable so we can continue to do deals and there are no economic or military crises,\" Hirt said. \"Tread lightly, because if there is a condo boom and the music stops, the first to suffer will be those projects in not a great location; the others will eventually sell out,\" Davis warned. Gertenlauer notes they are making investments \"on a very cautious basis\" in the major US food groups of office, hotel, retail and industrial, with a small appetite outside the US. \"We could slip back into a downturn in a month or this cycle could last for years,\" she added.",

        "text": "The real low-wage issue: Not enough hours. Naquasia LeGrand makes about $6,000 per year at a KFC in New York City. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) Low wages has become the raging issue of the day, sparking protests and discussions nationwide. But dig a little deeper, and workers say another problem is gnawing at their paychecks: not getting enough hours at work. Many fast food and retail employees say it is hard to make anything above poverty-level wages because they don't get scheduled to work enough. Advocates say many employers don't give workers sufficient hours as a way to avoid paying benefits. Take Naquasia LeGrand, who works 15 hours a week at KFC in New York City and has been asking to work more days to no avail. She brings home $120 per week, or $6,000 per year. LeGrand said the maximum number of hours scheduled for any worker at her KFC is 25 per week. It's not that there's less work; she said her manager has hired additional part-time employees when there's need. She used to work more hours at a different KFC, as well, but that location closed down. LeGrand's manager would not comment on her claim. Its fast food corporate parent, Yum Brands ( YUM , Fortune 500 ) , said that most of its stores are franchise-owned, but it pays competitive wages and offers opportunities to help workers build careers. With such few working hours, even a higher wage would likely not make that much of a difference for LeGrand. If the minimum wage was raised to $10.10 per hour, as Senate Democrats have proposed, LeGrand would make an additional $30 more per week, the equivalent of a tank of gas. Experts say that the retail and fast food industries are the most common perpetrators of such low part-time work hours. This way, they can avoid paying out benefits that employees qualify for if they work about 30-plus hours a week. By 2015, Obamacare laws will require employers with 50 or more full-time workers to provide health insurance or face penalties. \"Employers often prefer part-time workers because they don't have to pay benefits and can pay [them] less per hour than full-timers,\" said Arne Kalleberg, a professor of sociology who studies part-time labor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \"They can also schedule workers to work at peak times, and not have to schedule them when things aren't busy.\" Employers seem to be able to get away with this tactic because of the easy availability of low-wage workers at a time when high joblessness plagues the nation. The share of part-time workers who couldn't find full-time jobs surged during the Great Recession, more than double what it was in the preceding decade. Though their situation has improved recently, more than 7.7 million Americans are still settling for part-time work, compared to about 4.1 million on average in 2006. It has led to the kinds of fast food protests that LeGrand has participated in. Last fall, organizers said the protests spread to 100 cities . Wal-Mart ( WMT , Fortune 500 ) workers have also staged similar actions in the past year. Besides being low-paying, these jobs are also notorious for having inconsistent schedules, which can wreak havoc for workers who are trying to study for a degree or run a household and worry about child care. \"Workers often have no idea how many hours they'll be scheduled for each week, if they'll have to work the day shift or the night shift, if you'll be able to make plans to go to school or take care of your kids,\" said Kendall Fells, organizing director of Fast Food Forward, one group that has organized fast food protests . The situation looks bleak for LeGrand, who shares a phone with her grandmother and can only afford to eat fast food or $1 pizza slices. Sometimes she can't afford to get breakfast. \"I'm just trying to keep my head up and I'm hoping things will get better,\" LeGrand said.",

        "text": "Savings account lotteries: Win up to $25,000. LaVerne and DeAnn Brickner won $25,000 through their prize-linked savings account. Click the image above for more stories from winners. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) DeAnn Brickner dropped the phone on the living room floor when she got the call last January telling her that she and her husband, LaVerne, had just won $25,000. The couple had bought a handful of lottery tickets throughout the year, but it wasn't a Mega Millions or Powerball official on the phone -- it was someone from their local credit union. \"[My wife] just stood there in shock ... I had no clue what was going on, I thought someone had died,\" said LaVerne, who is from Kearney, Neb. \"We went to bed that night going, 'Wow, tell us this again when we wake up in the morning to make sure we're not dreaming.'\" Across the country, states are passing legislation allowing credit unions to offer prize-linked savings accounts, where customers are entered into a lottery and given the chance to win an annual grand prize of up to $25,000. It all started in Michigan. Unlike most states, Michigan's law already allowed credit unions to offer games of chance, like a raffle or a lottery. In 2009, eight credit unions in the state began offering prize-linked certificates of deposit through a program called Save to Win. Since then, the program has grown its fleet of credit unions to 58, and the average savings account balance has increased from $734 to $2,873, with the majority of customers rolling over their 12-month CDs from year-to-year. That success has led other states to take notice. In addition to Michigan, six other states have passed laws allowing credit unions to offer prize-linked savings accounts, according to the Doorways to Dreams Fund, which helped launch the Save to Win program. Connecticut is the latest to do so, passing legislation last year, and a New York bill is expected to be reintroduced this year. And while federal law prohibits banks from running lotteries, a new bill introduced in Congress in October would make it possible for these institutions to offer prize-linked savings accounts in states that also permit it. Here's how it works: When you sign up for a 12-month CD and deposit at least $25, you receive one ticket for the lottery. Every $25 you add to the account after that qualifies you for another chance to win -- up to a maximum of 10 chances per month. But if you dip into that CD before its maturity date, you're typically charged a $25 fee, and you're only allowed to withdraw money once per term. Individual credit unions hold monthly drawings where you can win small prizes of $50 and up, and then there's an annual lottery run by all participating credit unions in the state that selects the grand prize winners. \"When [participants] find out they get a prize, they are just ecstatic because most are hardworking, middle-class people,\" said Dave Adams, CEO of the Michigan Credit Union League. \"These accounts are not geared toward people with lots of money, they're geared toward people who aren't regular savers.\" In a recent survey of Save to Win members, between 42% and 59% (depending on the state) described themselves as \"non-regular savers,\" and between 35% and 55% said they earned less than $40,000. Save a million before you retire. Prize-linked savings accounts operate differently depending on the state. In Michigan, the credit union pays a subscription fee of between $1,000 and $10,000, which is pooled in order to pay out 10 annual grand prizes of $10,000 each. In Nebraska, there's only one grand prize winner per year, but the prize is $25,000. Since 2009, credit unions have doled out more than $1 million to more than 10,000 Save to Win customers -- with 22 people winning $10,000 or more. What's in it for credit unions? More deposits, and more loyal customers who may begin taking out loans or opening credit cards, says Adams. Between 55% and 75% of Save to Win customers said they are more likely to use another product at their credit union after using the prize-linked saving account. Overall, more than 40,000 Save to Win accounts have been opened and $70 million has been saved through the program between 2009 and 2012. Meanwhile, a recent study from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that prize-linked savings accounts do indeed lead consumers to save more than a regular interest-bearing account. It also found that the product appeals most to men, consumers with low bank account balances and lottery players. More than 60 credit unions have also taken the initiative a step further and partnered with a company called SaveUp, which awards money and other prizes to members who do things like pay down debt. \"Interest rates are so abysmal that they're not enough to motivate you to save ... these accounts actually do that,\" said Joanna Smith-Ramani, director of Scale Strategies at the Doorways to Dreams Fund.",

        "text": "Japan's ties with India do not target any country. They are solely intended to strengthen peace and stability in Asia. So now we know. Thank you, Headlines Today, for revealing the deep-rooted conspiracy at the heart of today's politics. No, it has nothing to do with Muzaffarnagar and possible LeT recruitment in the refugee camps there \u0097 the subject of much debate on NDTV 24\u1e6a7, Times Now and CNN-IBN, Tuesday night. No, Headlines Today has snooped around and come up with a new expose of the Congress. What, again? What now? Now, it's the Congress's AAP \"gameplan\". It's Machiavellian \"plot\" is to have the AAP erode the BJP's vote share in the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections in anything between 50-100 seats, depending on whether the new party's vote share is 5 or 10 per cent. Headlines Today buttressed its argument by citing the example of Raj Thackeray's MNS in Maharashtra during the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, where it played a spoiler for the BJP-Shiv Sena by eating into their vote share \u0097 and, as a result, helping the Congress win more seats. What was unclear from this fascinating piece of journalism is the precise nature of the role played by the Congress in the current AAP electoral strategy. From all that we have learnt from media reports, the AAP has decided to fight a large number of Lok Sabha seats \u0097 but without consulting Rahul G or Sonia ji. So where is the Congress hand in the AAP \"gameplan\"? Headlines Today doesn't say. The AAP may or may not eat into the BJP's vote share, but certainly it has already eaten into the BJP's media exposure. How often do you see Narendra Modi on your news channels nowadays? Sporadically, where once he was a daily, nay an hourly fixture. Since the December assembly election results, he's been replaced by AAP, Muzaffarnagar, Rahul Gandhi and even the prime minister in the pecking order. This hiatus from the media spotlight may be good for the BJP's prime ministerial candidate: many would say, Modi has been overexposed too early in the run-up to this summer's elections. Watching Hindi entertainment channels is to live inside a bubble that insulates you from the world outside. Other than crime shows such as Crime Patrol Dastak (Sony), TV shows fail to mirror contemporary urban life \u0097 or even provide a glancing reference to the social and political upheavals we are witnessing, say, in a city like Delhi. A show like Nandini (Sony) has young people, including an \"aam\" woman, striving in the political sphere but it is an exception. Otherwise, you have shows such as Firangi Bahu (Sahara One) where one Camili Jonathan is married into the Desai family residing in Rajkot. She's more the Indian bahu than Sonia Gandhi or Kahani Ghar Ghar Ki's ideal, Parvati. So what if she is blond? That's just a hair colour away, anyway. She wears a saree, performs all the duties of a perfect daughter-in-law and even speaks in Hindi. Well, if you can call it that. She sounds like pebbles are weighing down her tongue, that too curiously for an Englishwoman, with an American accent. Remind me, why do we make shows such as this one?",

        "text": "Related. Senior AAP leader and Delhi Urban Development Minister Manish Sisodia Wednesday said there is a possibility that the party's cadre could indulge in \"political goondaism\" and that senior leaders were \"scared\" and \"conscious\" of this. The AAP leadership, he said, would send out a strong message to volunteers indulging in such practices. Speaking at the Idea Exchange programme of The Indian Express, Sisodia, a founder-member of AAP, said the issue was very sensitive. \"I will honestly say that one path for the party is towards goondaism. Political goondaism. We have seen this a lot in India, when a political party comes to power and the party's followers, in the name of power or the ruling party, resort to goondaism. We are very scared and we are conscious about that,\" Sisodia said. According to the debutant minister, it was necessary to ensure such activities be stopped as soon as possible. \"I agree that strict action should be taken against any AAP volunteer or party member or anybody masquerading as one in an AAP cap. It is paramount that we show how serious we are about this even if it involves a close volunteer,\" Sisodia said. However, Sisodia also maintained that although the party leadership was against goondaism, it was important for society to get involved. \"For example, take the education volunteers. They have been vetted by me and are not AAP party members. I can vouch for each of them and they have no authority other than to observe and report to me of the condition of schools,\" he said. The minister also said that more than a mechanism, it was important to send a message. \"What you do once such an incident is reported is important. If this (goondaism) comes to our notice, we will hit back and hit back hard. We will hit back so strongly that the message will go out among all our volunteers,\" Sisodia said.",

        "text": "After the bullet shells get counted, the blood dries and the votive candles burn out, people peer down from windows and see crime scenes gone cold: a band of yellow police tape blowing in the breeze. The South Bronx, just across the Harlem River from Manhattan and once shorthand for urban dysfunction, still suffers violence at levels long ago slashed in many other parts of New York City. And yet the city\u2019s efforts to fight it remain splintered, underfunded and burdened by scandal. In the 40th Precinct, at the southern tip of the Bronx, as in other poor, minority neighborhoods across the country, people long hounded for infractions are crying out for more protection against grievous injury or death. By September, four of every five shootings in the precinct this year were unsolved. Out of the city\u2019s 77 precincts, the 40th has the highest murder rate but the fewest detectives per violent crime, reflecting disparities in staffing that hit hardest in some neighborhoods outside Manhattan, according to a New York Times analysis of Police Department data. Investigators in the precinct are saddled with twice the number of cases the department recommends, even as their bosses are called to Police Headquarters to answer for the sharpest crime rise in the city this year. And across the Bronx, investigative resources are squeezed. It has the highest rate of the city\u2019s five boroughs but the thinnest detective staffing. Nine of the 14 precinct detective squads for violent crime in the city are there. The borough\u2019s robbery squad is smaller than Manhattan\u2019s, even though the Bronx has had 1, 300 more cases this year. And its homicide squad has one detective for every four murders, compared with one detective for roughly every two murders in Upper Manhattan and more than one detective per murder in Lower Manhattan. In lobbies and family apartments, outside methadone clinics and art studios, people take note of the inequity. They hear police commanders explain that they lack the resources to place a floodlight on a dangerous block or to post officers at a corner. They watch witnesses cower behind doors, more fearful of a gunman\u2019s crew than confident in the Police Department\u2019s ability to protect them. So though people see a lot, they rarely testify. And in the South Bronx, as in so many predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhoods like it in the United States, the contract between the police and the community is in tatters. Some people have stories of crime reports that were ignored, or 911 calls that went unanswered for hours. Others tell of a 911 call for help ending in the caller\u2019s arrest, or of a minor charge leading to 12 hours in a fetid holding cell. This is the paradox of policing in the 40th Precinct. Its neighborhoods have historically been prime targets for aggressive tactics, like that are designed to ward off disorder. But precinct detectives there have less time than anywhere else in the city to answer for the blood spilled in violent crimes. Gola White, who was beside her daughter when she was shot and killed in a playground this summer, four years after her son was gunned down in the same housing project, ticked off the public safety resources that she said were scant in Bronx neighborhoods like hers: security cameras, lights, locks, investigating police officers. \u201cHere, we have nothing,\u201d she said. When it comes to \u201c families,\u201d she said, the authorities \u201cdon\u2019t really care as much. That\u2019s how I feel. \u201d The Times has been documenting the murders logged this year in the 40th Precinct, one of a handful of neighborhoods where deadly violence remains a problem in an era of crime in New York City. The homicides \u2014 14 in the precinct this year, up from nine in 2015 \u2014 strain detectives, and when they go unsolved, as half of them have this year, some look to take the law into their own hands. From hundreds of conversations with grieving relatives and friends, witnesses and police officers, the social forces that flare into murder in a place like the 40th Precinct become clearer: merciless gang codes, mental illness, drugs and long memories of feuds that simmered out of officers\u2019 view. The reasons some murders will never be solved also emerge: paralyzing fear of retribution, victims carrying secrets to their graves and relentless casework that forces detectives to move on in hopes that a break will come later. Frustrations build on all sides. Detectives\u2019 phones rarely ring with tips, and officers grow embittered with witnesses who will not cooperate. In the meantime, a victim\u2019s friends conduct their own investigations, and talk of grabbing a stash gun from a wheel well or a mother\u2019s apartment when they find their suspect. In the chasm between the police and the community, gangs and gun violence flourish. Parents try to protect their families from drug crews\u2019 threats, and officers work to overcome the residue of years of mistrust and understaffing in communities where they still go racing from one 911 call to the next. The streets around St. Mary\u2019s Park were the scene of two fatal shootings logged in the 40th Precinct this year. Both are unsolved. James Fernandez heard talk of the murders through the door of his apartment on East 146th Street in a the Betances Houses. He lived at the end of a long hallway strewn with hypodermic needles, empty dope bags and discarded Hennessy bottles. A young men who spoke of being in a subset of the Bloods gang had made it their drug market, slinging marijuana and cocaine to regulars, flashing firearms and blowing smoke into the Fernandez apartment. When Mr. Fernandez, 40, asked the young men to move, they answered by busting up his car. This kind of crime, an anachronism in much of New York, still rattles the 40th Precinct, even though murders there have fallen to 14 this year from 83 in 1991. It has more major felony crimes per resident than any other residential district in the city. It is also one of the poorest communities in the country, and many young men find their way into underground markets. Mr. Fernandez was not one to shrink from the threats. When he was growing up on the Lower East Side, he rode his bicycle around to the customers of the drug dealers he worked for and collected payments in a backpack. After leaving that life, he got a tech maintenance job and, three years ago, moved into the Betances Houses with his wife and daughter, now 11. He had two choices to get help with the drug crew: call the police for help and risk being labeled a snitch, or call his old Lower East Side bosses for muscle and risk violence. He chose the police. Again and again, he walked into a local substation, Police Service Area 7, and asked for protection. His daughter was using an inhaler to relieve coughs from the marijuana smoke. Mr. Fernandez and his wife got terrible headaches. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of killers here, and we are going to kill you,\u201d a sergeant\u2019s police report quoted a telling Mr. Fernandez in August 2015. A second report filed the same day said a warned him, \u201cI\u2019m going to shoot through your window. \u201d Mr. Fernandez told the police both the teenagers\u2019 names, which appear in the reports, and then went home. He said one of their friends had seen him walk into the substation, and they tried to intimidate him out of filing another report. Three days later, the same propped his bike on their door, \u201cthen said if I was to open the door and say something, they would body slam me,\u201d Mr. Fernandez\u2019s wife, Maria Fernandez, wrote on slips of paper she used to document the hallway ruckus and the inadequate police response. The boys made comments about how easy a target she was and about how they would have to \u201cslap\u201d her if she opened the door while they made a drug sale, and they threatened to beat the Fernandez family because \u201cthey are the ones snitching,\u201d her notes say. But another complaint at the substation, 10 days after the first, brought no relief. A week later, feeling desperate, Ms. Fernandez tried calling: first to the substation, at 8:50 p. m. when one of the boys blew weed smoke at her door and made a threat to attack her, and then to 911 at 10:36 p. m. The police never came, she wrote in her notes. She tried the 40th Precinct station house next, but officers at the desk left her standing in the public waiting area for a she said, making her fear being seen again. Officers put her in worse danger some months later, she said, when they came to her door and announced in front of the teenagers that they were there on a complaint about drug activity. Mr. Fernandez started doing the work that he said the police had failed to do. He wired a camera into his peephole to record the drugs and guns. The footage hark back to the New York of the 1980s, still very much present to some of the precinct\u2019s residents. Around 6:30 each morning, Sgt. Michael J. LoPuzzo walks through the tall wooden doors of the 40th Precinct station house. The cases that land on his metal desk \u2014 dead bodies with no known cause, strip club brawls, shooting victims hobbling into the hospital themselves \u2014 bring resistance at every turn, reminding him of an earlier era in the city\u2019s campaign. \u201cI haven\u2019t got one single phone call that\u2019s putting me in the right direction here,\u201d said Sergeant LoPuzzo, the head of the precinct\u2019s detective squad, one day this summer as he worked on an answer to an email inquiry from a murder victim\u2019s aunt about why the killer had not been caught. \u201cAnd people just don\u2019t understand that. \u201d Often it is detectives who most feel the effects of people turning on the police. Witnesses shout them away from their doors just so neighbors know they refuse to talk. Of the 184 people who were shot and wounded in the Bronx through early September, more than a third \u2014 66 victims \u2014 refused to cooperate. Over the same period in the 40th Precinct, squad detectives closed three of 17 nonfatal shootings, and 72 of 343 robbery cases. Part of the resistance stems from preventive policing tactics, like that were a hallmark of the style under former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and his police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly. Near the height of the strategy, in 2012, the 40th Precinct had the stops in the city, the stops in which officers used force and the most frisks. Of 18, 276 stops that year, 15, 521 were of people who had done nothing criminal. The precinct was also one of the areas that the department flooded with its newest officers. At roll calls, they were pressured to generate numbers: write tickets and make arrests. They had no choice but to give a summons to a young man playing in a park after dark, even if the officers had done the same growing up in the same neighborhood. \u201cI need to bring something in today to justify my existence,\u201d Officer Argenis Rosado, who joined the precinct in 2010, said in an interview at the station house. \u201cSo now you\u2019re in a small area, and day after day you\u2019re hammering the same community. Of course that community\u2019s eventually going to turn on you. \u201d The pressure warped the way officers and residents saw each other. Rookies had to ignore why someone might be drinking outside or sitting on a stoop. \u201cSome of the cops that came out at that time probably viewed the community differently, too,\u201d said Hector Espada, a veteran of the precinct. \u201cNot because they wanted to, but because they had to. Because some way or somehow, you can\u2019t give someone a $115 summons and feel like you guys could still have a civil conversation after that. \u201d Morale wilted in the aged station house on Alexander Avenue, in Mott Haven. Officers felt pressure to downgrade crime complaints to make them appear less serious. Several said in interviews that they had overlooked crime reports from immigrants because they were seen as unlikely to complain, and watched supervisors badger victims into repeating their stories in hopes that they would drop their complaints. The practice of downgrading complaints resulted in the disciplining of 19 officers in the precinct last year, one in a string of scandals that has left officers there feeling overscrutinized for problems that also existed elsewhere. Four commanders in the precinct were sent packing in five years, one of them after officers were found to be \u201cticket fixing,\u201d or forgiving parking tickets for friends, and another after he was recorded giving guidance on whom to stop and frisk: black boys and men, ages 14 to 21. Some officers fled to other commands. Others became reluctant to take assignments in proactive policing units, like that put them in situations on the street. \u201cWhenever I walked through the doors of the precinct, to me, it seemed like a black cloud,\u201d said Russell Lewis, a of the 40th. \u201cIt was like a heaviness. When you walked in, all you wanted to do was do your 8 hours 35 minutes and go home, because you didn\u2019t want to get caught up in anything. \u201d The precinct covers only about two square miles, but the more than a dozen housing projects there mean that it overflows with people. Methadone clinics draw addicts from around the city. lofts on the southern edge of the precinct presage a wave of gentrification. Even as the Police Department has hired 1, 300 more officers for neighborhood policing and counterterrorism, officers in the 40th Precinct said they could still rush to 25 911 calls during a shift \u2014 a number unchanged from what the new police commissioner, James P. O\u2019Neill, said he was handling in a similar South Bronx precinct 15 years ago. Several dozen calls at a time can be waiting for a response. Residents know that if you want the police for a domestic problem, it helps to hint that there is a weapon. Last year, the precinct drew the number of civilian complaints for officer misconduct in the city, and the most lawsuits stemming from police actions. The precinct is trying to improve morale under a new commanding officer, Deputy Inspector Brian Hennessy. A cadre of what the department calls neighborhood coordination officers has been on patrol since last January, part of a citywide effort under Mr. O\u2019Neill and Mayor Bill de Blasio to bring back the beat cop, unencumbered by chasing every last 911 call, who can listen to people\u2019s concerns and help with investigations. The precinct has made among the most gun arrests in the city, and officers said they now had more discretion to resolve encounters without a summons or an arrest. At one corner near a school, on Courtlandt Avenue and East 151st Street, that has long spawned complaints about gunfire and fights, Inspector Hennessy and some of his officers painted over graffiti and swept up drug paraphernalia this summer. People said it was the first answer to their complaints in years. But the inspector acknowledged that the residue of policing lingers. \u201cThat perception really sticks,\u201d he said. The workload in the 40th Precinct is startling and reveals a gap in how detective squads are equipped to answer violent crime in Manhattan compared with the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens. Three of the precinct\u2019s 16 detectives are carrying more than 400 cases each this year, and many others have loads in the high 300s, even though the department advises 150 in violent precincts. When they are assigned a homicide, they typically have four days to investigate before dealing with other cases. Quieter precincts can give detectives a month with little distraction to investigate a murder. Detectives in the 40th Precinct have each handled an average of 79 violent felonies this year through \u2014 murders, rapes, felony assaults and robberies. By contrast, a detective in the precinct on the southern end of Staten Island carries nine such cases a detective in the precinct patrolling Union Square and Gramercy Park handles 16 and a detective in the precinct for most of Washington Heights handles 32, the citywide median. Last year, the 40th was the for violent crime, with 65 cases per detective. In the Bronx as a whole, a precinct detective has carried an average of 58 violent felonies this year, compared with 27 in Manhattan, 37 in Brooklyn, 38 in Queens and 25 on Staten Island. Rape cases and robbery patterns are later sent to more specialized units, but precinct detectives do extensive initial work to interview victims, write reports and process evidence. Precincts in much of Manhattan, which are whiter and wealthier than the South Bronx, often have more property felonies, like stolen laptops or credit cards, and the police say those can be complex. But even accounting for those crimes, the 40th Precinct has some of the heaviest caseloads of overall crime per detective in the city. Michael Palladino, the head of the Detectives\u2019 Endowment Association and a former Bronx officer, said staffing disparities affected the department\u2019s efforts to build trust in communities like the South Bronx. Witnesses make a calculation, he said: \u201cIf I cooperate with the detectives, there\u2019s so much work, there\u2019s so few of them there, they won\u2019t even get the chance to protect me, or they\u2019ll be there too late when the retaliation comes. \u201d Sergeant LoPuzzo, who turned down a more prestigious post to stay in the 40th Precinct, said that his squad worked tirelessly to handle cases with the people he had, and that while every squad wanted more detectives, staffing needs for counterterrorism units and task forces had created new deployment challenges across the department. \u201cWe fight with the army we have, not the army we wish we had,\u201d he said. Details of how the Police Department assigns its 36, 000 officers are closely held and constantly in flux, and the public has minimal information on how personnel are allocated. Presented with The Times\u2019s analysis of confidential staffing data, the department\u2019s chief of detectives, Robert K. Boyce, vowed to send more detectives to the 40th Precinct and said the department would reassess its deployment more broadly in troubled precincts. He said a recent decision to bring gang, narcotics and vice detectives under his command made it easier to shift personnel. Chief Boyce said the burdens on detectives went beyond felony crimes to include and cases. And he noted the support that precinct squads got from centralized units focusing on robberies, gangs or grand larcenies, for example. Major crime keeps pounding the 40th Precinct, at rates that in 2015 were only a tenth of a percent lower than in 2001, even as citywide crime dropped by more than a third over the same period. But the precinct\u2019s detective squad shrank by about eight investigators during those years, according to staffing data obtained from the City Council through a Freedom of Information Law request. The squad covering Union Square and Gramercy Park, where crime dropped by a third over that period, grew by about 11 investigators. (The 40th Precinct was given an additional detective and four investigators this summer, when it was already missing three detectives for illness or other reasons.) Retired detectives are skeptical that community relations alone can drive down crime in the city\u2019s last \u201c\u201d the busiest precincts. Rather, they say, the Police Department should be dedicating more resources to providing the same sort of robust investigative response that seems standard in Manhattan. \u201cAny crime in Manhattan has to be solved,\u201d said Howard Landesberg, who was a 40th Precinct detective in the late 1980s. \u201cThe outer boroughs are, like, forgotten. \u201d Retired detectives said that understaffing made it harder to solve crimes in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, where the higher prevalence of gang and drug killings already saddled investigators with cases in which people were not inclined to cooperate. Through detectives had closed 67 percent of homicides in Manhattan and 76 percent of those in Staten Island this year, compared with 54 percent of those in the Bronx, 42 percent of those in Queens and 31 percent of those in Brooklyn. Of last year\u2019s homicides, detectives cleared 71 percent in Manhattan, 63 percent in the Bronx, 62 percent in Queens, 57 percent in Staten Island and 31 percent in Brooklyn. \u201cIt\u2019s the culture of the Police Department that they worry about Manhattan,\u201d said Joseph L. Giacalone, a former sergeant in the Bronx Cold Case Squad, in part \u201cbecause that\u2019s where the money is. \u201d He added: \u201cWhen de Blasio came in, he talked about the tale of two cities. And then he\u2019s done the complete opposite of what he said. It\u2019s just business as usual. \u201d The Bronx\u2019s struggles extend into prosecutions. In each of the last five years, prosecutors in the Bronx have declined to prosecute violent felony cases more than anywhere else in the city. And the rate of conviction in the Bronx is routinely the lowest in the city as well, but has ticked up this year to surpass Brooklyn\u2019s rate through November as Bronx prosecutors work to streamline cases. Some cases have become even more difficult to win because of the problem in the 40th Precinct, which has allowed defense lawyers to attack the credibility of officers who were implicated, said Patrice O\u2019Shaughnessy, a spokeswoman for the Bronx District Attorney\u2019s office. The district attorney, Darcel D. Clark, elected in 2015, said in a statement, \u201cI was a judge here in the Bronx, and I heard from jurors that they can\u2019t be impartial because they don\u2019t trust the police. \u201d Against that tide of mistrust, Sergeant LoPuzzo\u2019s detectives work 36 hours straight on some fresh cases. They buy Chinese takeout with their own money for a murder suspect. They carry surveillance videos home in hopes that their personal computers may enhance them better than a squad computer. They buy an urn for a homeless mother who has her murdered son\u2019s ashes in a box. In the months after a killing, they can seem like the only people in this glittering city who are paying attention to the 40th Precinct\u2019s homicide victims. Newly fatherless children go back to school without a therapist\u2019s help. Victims\u2019 families wander confused through a courthouse and nearly miss an appearance. Newspapers largely ignore killings of people with criminal pasts, pushing them down the priority lists of the chiefs at Police Headquarters. In a stuffy squad room, the detectives of the 40th Precinct grapple with an inheritance of government neglect. They meet mothers who believe their sons might never have been murdered had a city guidance counselor listened to pleas to help them stay enrolled, or had a city housing worker fixed the locks or lights on a building. And the detectives work alongside a vicious system on the streets for punishing police cooperators. Young men scan court paperwork in prison, looking for the names of people who turned on them. One murder victim in the precinct this year was cast out of his crew after he avoided being arrested with them in a gang takedown some believed he was cooperating. A longtime 40th Precinct detective, Jeff Meenagh, said a witness in a homicide case was going to testify until he went back to his neighborhood and was told that anyone who testified would \u201cget what you deserve. \u201d The allies Sergeant LoPuzzo makes are friendly only for so long. He helped clear a woman\u2019s son of a robbery charge by locating surveillance video that proved he was not the robber. The mother started calling with tips under a code name \u2014 about a gun under a car, for example. But she always refused to testify. And she cut ties this year after Sergeant LoPuzzo arrested her son in the stabbing of two people and her in a shooting. New York City owns East 146th Street and the buildings on each side. But James Fernandez, in the Betances Houses, said the reality on the ground was different: The drug boss ran the block. By October, Mr. Fernandez was increasingly afraid \u2014 and fed up. Mr. Fernandez and his wife went so far as to give officers keys to the building door, so they could get in whenever they wanted, showed them the videos and offered them access to his camera so they could see what was happening in the hallway. A couple of officers said they needed a supervisor\u2019s permission to do more. Others answered that the young men were only making threats. Officers occasionally stopped outside their building, causing the young men to scatter, but did not come inside, Mr. Fernandez said. The menacing worsened. Mr. Fernandez\u2019s daughter was harassed as she arrived home from school. She grew more and more distressed, and her parents had her start seeing a therapist. Mr. Fernandez made several complaints at the office of the borough president, Ruben Diaz Jr. and visited a victim\u2019s advocate in the district attorney\u2019s office. On Oct. 20, 2015, he sent an online note to the police commissioner\u2019s office. \u201cWe went to all proper channels for help,\u201d the note said. \u201cBoth precincts failed us, except 2 officers who helped us, but their hands are tied. No one else to turn to. I have months of video of multiple crimes taking place and we are in extreme danger. \u201d \u201c40th and PSA 7 won\u2019t do anything,\u201d he wrote, referring to the local substation. \u201cPlease we need to speak to some one with authority. \u201d The local substation commander, Deputy Inspector Jerry O\u2019Sullivan, and the Bronx narcotics unit were alerted to the complaints. But Mr. Fernandez said he never heard from them. So he relied on his own street instincts to protect his family. He made pleas to a man he thought was employing the dealers in the hallway. The activity quieted briefly, but it returned after the young men rented a room in a woman\u2019s apartment upstairs. Mr. Fernandez approached a different man who he learned was the boss of the operation. The man agreed to ask the dealers to calm down. He even hired a drug customer to sweep the hallway, Mr. Fernandez said. But two weeks later, the dealing and the harassment resumed. So he went to his old Lower East Side bosses, who hired men to trail his wife and daughter on their way out of the building and make sure they made it safely to school. At other times they sat outside the Betances Houses. He also bought two bulletproof vests, for about $700 each. He could not find one small enough for his daughter. \u201cI have no faith in the City of New York, I have no faith in the police, I have no faith in the politicians,\u201d Mr. Fernandez said. \u201cThe only thing I know for sure: God, if we\u2019re in a situation again, I will be left to defend my family. \u201d Paying such close attention to what was happening in the hallway, Mr. Fernandez said he learned some details about two recent homicides that the 40th Precinct was investigating. But because his calls for help were going nowhere, he said he decided not to put himself in greater risk by talking: He would not tell the police what he had learned. \u201cI\u2019m bending over backward, and nobody\u2019s not even doing anything,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy am I going to help you, if you ain\u2019t going to help me?\u201d By last January, a new neighborhood coordination officer was working with residents of the Betances Houses, and ended up with the most arrests in his housing command, Inspector O\u2019Sullivan said. Chief Boyce said that the silos in which gang and narcotics detectives used to work made responding to complaints more difficult, but that the recent restructuring would remove those obstacles. \u201cNo one should live like Mr. Fernandez lived, with people dealing drugs outside of his apartment,\u201d he said. Mr. Fernandez\u2019s complaints did not spur any arrests, but two men from the hallway were caught separately this year in shootings. One of them, whom Mr. Fernandez named in a police report, was charged this summer with hitting an officer with a metal folding chair and firing three gunshots into a crowd, court papers say. He is being held on Rikers Island on an attempted murder charge. That was too late for Mr. Fernandez. By May, he had moved his family away.",

        "text": "It\u2019s that time of year when financial advice sites issue their lists of the \u201cStocks to Buy for 2017. \u201d Before you take them up on their suggestions, let\u2019s look at how well such portfolios did in 2016. The portfolios of stocks they were telling you to buy generally did much worse than the stock market over all. The results underline what many personal finance experts recommend: Invest in a broad, mutual index fund. (The Times\u2019s \u201cYour Money\u201d columnist wrote more on this here.) In 2016, the broad S. P. stock index increased 9. 5 percent. But if you invested in Forbes\u2019s 2016 list, your money grew about 7 percent. Kiplinger\u2019s was about half that. A list that appeared on the Money magazine site garnered 4. 9 percent, and Barron\u2019s returned 5. 3 percent. One such list at CNBC did a little better than most at 10. 6 percent. But Vanguard\u2019s Total Stock index fund returned 12. 5 percent in the same period. We even calculated these returns by assuming that any of the dividends were reinvested, but still none beat the widely owned index fund. There is nothing wrong with these lists if you are using them as mere suggestions of what companies might be worth investigating. There were some bona fide winners on almost every list: Goldman Sachs, Kennametal, Ellie Mae, Douglas Dynamics, Burlington Stores. You might not have heard of some of those companies, so it\u2019s not a bad place to look for ideas. But the problem with such lists is that they encourage people to approach investing the wrong way. Unsophisticated investors are being persuaded that they should own a sheaf of stocks. But as you can see, even when the stocks are recommended by professional money managers and filtered through some of the best financial journalists, they don\u2019t do as well as the averages. The best advice remains the same: If you have money you want to play with, go have some fun with a few stocks that you can monitor closely. If you keep it simple, it\u2019s easier to track and respond. But for the rest of us, the smart investment is those index funds. They cost less than stocks or other funds. They remove most of the emotion from your decision making, which is the cause of a lot of bad decisions. That\u2019s your best bet in 2017.",

        "text": "Alicia Rivera, a single mother with four children and big dreams, must budget her money and her time wisely. \u201cI got my kids,\u201d Ms. Rivera said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to waste my time. \u201d Ms. Rivera and her children \u2014 Joaquin, 17 Nelson, 16 Alyssa, 11 and Rafael, 2 \u2014 live in a apartment in the Bronx, near the southern tip of the Bronx River Parkway. The past few years have sometimes been overwhelming for her as she tries to raise her children by herself, get an education and lay the foundation for a professional career. When she was seven months pregnant with Rafael, Ms. Rivera injured her back while working as a home health aide. Soon after he was born, she switched to another job, helping people navigate complicated real estate and tax forms and other paperwork. Ms. Rivera makes about $100 every week. She also receives $216 a month in Supplemental Security Income and $506 a month in food stamps. With a monthly rent of $308, she needs to keep a frugal budget. But Ms. Rivera has a plan. She is on track to receive an associate degree from Plaza College in April. Her goal is to then earn a bachelor\u2019s degree and a master\u2019s degree, both in business, from Metropolitan College of New York. She dreams of opening a dance studio in the Bronx. Ms. Rivera grew up in the Bronx with a mother who could not afford to send her to dance classes. But she loved dancing in front of the family\u2019s television as they watched the variety show \u201cS\u00e1bado Gigante. \u201d \u201cAnd you see these kids dancing, and you see me dancing in the living room, too,\u201d Ms. Rivera said. \u201cI used to wear my mom\u2019s makeup, her heels. \u201d Ms. Rivera passed on her love of dancing to her children, especially Joaquin, who leads a dance team at his school, the Knowledge and Power Preparatory Academy, near Fordham University in the Bronx. She watched him at a dance rehearsal at the school, and she said the students\u2019 moves reminded her of the \u201cStep Up\u201d movie series. \u201cMade me laugh, made me have a good time,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt like joining them,\u201d she said, beaming. At times, Ms. Rivera has struggled to balance her obligations at home, school and work. As she devoted more time to her studies, her son Nelson, who attends the same academy as Joaquin, started having trouble at school. A counselor there contacted her, saying that Nelson did not want to go to class. The counselor referred her to the Family Assistance Program, which soon referred them to the Children\u2019s Aid Society, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. At Children\u2019s Aid, Ms. Rivera said, she learned how to improve her parenting. She said she used to get frustrated and yell at Nelson when he struggled to get up and get ready in the morning. A counselor told her that yelling at him was not going to solve the problem. Therapy sessions with the family also made it clear that her sons needed their own rooms. Ms. Rivera said she started to notice positive changes at home after several months of therapy. Her older sons now have their own rooms. Alyssa agreed to share a room with her mother and Rafael. Her elder sons are more focused now. Nelson comes to her with problems, not letting them linger, and they work them out together. Joaquin is starting to research colleges. The Children\u2019s Aid Society also provided Ms. Rivera $413 in Neediest funds to replace her sons\u2019 broken beds with new ones. Nelson and a friend put them together, she said. While still attending school, Nelson is taking some online courses, which cost $49 a month. Ms. Rivera wants to withdraw Nelson to take online classes full time so that she can monitor his schoolwork more carefully. In addition to opening a dance school, Ms. Rivera wants to start a business similar to her present workplace. While the family has learned to resolve problems, Ms. Rivera refuses to lower her expectations. She bristles when she hears her children or their friends say they cannot do something. \u201cDon\u2019t say, \u2018I can\u2019t,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cJoaquin never says, \u2018I can\u2019t,\u2019 because he hears me. \u201d That is one way she lays the foundation for her children\u2019s future. Ms. Rivera said Alyssa was struggling one day with homework. So she took time out of her own schoolwork, encouraged her daughter and patiently walked her through the steps of writing a essay. \u201cIt took her three hours, and when she was done, I said, \u2018You see? You could do it. \u2019\u201d",

        "text": "Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said on Wednesday that with a complete overhaul of La Guardia Airport underway, he wants to rebuild New York City\u2019s other airport, John F. Kennedy International. Mr. Cuomo outlined a plan to spend more than $10 billion modernizing Kennedy\u2019s terminals and improving the highway and transit systems connected to the airport. He did not provide a timetable for the plan or say specifically where all of the money would come from. \u201cThe next step is to tackle J. F. K. because La Guardia isn\u2019t enough,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said, speaking at a meeting of the Association for a Better New York, a business group, in Manhattan. \u201cWe need to build a new airport at J. F. K. and go through the same process as we did with La Guardia. \u201d In promoting big infrastructure projects, including the Second Avenue subway, which opened Sunday, Mr. Cuomo is building his legacy in New York, and perhaps raising his national profile. The plans offered by Mr. Cuomo on Wednesday suggest that he does not intend to stop trying to impose his will on the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates La Guardia and J. F. K. The authority\u2019s commissioners are scheduled to meet on Thursday to vote on a $30 billion spending plan that includes only about $1 billion for improvements at J. F. K. When Mr. Cuomo formed an advisory group in 2015 to study how to improve J. F. K. he said the panel would make recommendations to the authority. But the authority\u2019s chairman, John J. Degnan, did not see the panel\u2019s final report until Tuesday. \u201cWe await an opportunity to review the details of the governor\u2019s proposal,\u201d Mr. Degnan said on Wednesday. \u201cWe will have to evaluate it against other compelling capital needs identified by the Port Authority, both within other airports and within other operations that we oversee. \u201d Mr. Degnan, an appointee of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican, has been at odds with Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, over the authority\u2019s spending priorities. The agency also operates the main commuter bus terminal in Manhattan and Newark Liberty International Airport. Mr. Cuomo pushed for $2. 5 billion in the capital plan for improvements at the New York airports, possibly including an AirTrain link from New York City\u2019s subway system to La Guardia. Mr. Cuomo\u2019s advisory panel suggested that most of the rest of the money \u2014 up to $7 billion \u2014 could come from private sources, including airlines that use J. F. K. Kennedy is a collection of terminals, some of which were built, at least in part, by the airlines that occupy them. JetBlue Airways and the authority split the cost of building Terminal 5, which opened in 2008. Delta Air Lines has spent more than $1 billion in the recent years to improve its facilities at Terminals 2 and 4. At La Guardia, the authority has committed $600 million to the rebuilding of Terminals C and D against an estimated cost of about $4 billion. That investment would come on top of a $4 billion rebuilding of the Central Terminal Building there, which began last year. Mr. Cuomo hopes to entice airlines to make similar investments at J. F. K. to compete for customers. He challenged airlines to make offers, saying Delta had called him at 5:45 a. m. on Wednesday. Mr. Cuomo did not mention seeking federal financing. Donald J. Trump has said he plans to make an ambitious investment in infrastructure a priority of his administration. As part of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s plan for J. F. K. Matthew Driscoll, New York State\u2019s transportation commissioner, said his agency would spend as much as $2 billion to improve the flow of traffic to and from the airport. The changes would include adding a lane to the Van Wyck Expressway and widening ramps at the busy interchange in Kew Gardens, Queens, which Mr. Driscoll said handles 250, 000 vehicles per day. Thomas F. Prendergast, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said that transit agencies would explore creating a ride between Manhattan and J. F. K. Travelers must now switch to the AirTrain from the subway or Long Island Rail Road, a transfer that Mr. Prendergast described as \u201cschlepping with your luggage. \u201d Though New York City owns the land under J. F. K. no one from City Hall attended Mr. Cuomo\u2019s speech. \u201cInvestments in New York City\u2019s airports are vitally important to our region\u2019s development,\u201d said Melissa Grace, a spokeswoman for Mayor Bill de Blasio. \u201cWe look forward to hearing more details about the plans for J. F. K. in the months to come. \u201d",

        "text": "On the morning of May 18, 2014, Violeta Lagunes was perplexed by a series of strange messages that appeared in her Gmail inbox. It was Election Day to choose the leadership of Mexico\u2019s Partido Acci\u00f3n Nacional, or PAN, and Lagunes, a former federal congresswoman, was holding a strategy meeting in her office in Puebla city. The emails seemed harmless, at least at first. One appeared to come from the account of a trusted colleague. It asked her to download and review a document. Lagunes clicked on the link, but it seemed to be broken, so she wrote back to her colleague and asked him to send it again. Elsewhere in her inbox was an email from Google warning her that someone had tried to log in to her account. Meanwhile, she began to receive phone calls from PAN allies, who claimed that they had received emails from Lagunes\u2019s account that she did not remember sending. Now Lagunes was worried. Around 1 o\u2019clock, she called the colleague who appeared to have emailed her. She reached him at a restaurant, where he was finishing lunch with other campaign allies. \u201cI did not send you an email,\u201d he insisted. A consultant with the campaign \u2014 who asked to remain anonymous in order to preserve his relationships with other candidates \u2014 overheard the conversation. He knew of other campaign workers who had been receiving similar messages: emails with vague subject lines, asking the recipient to review a document or click a link. The campaign, he realized, had been hacked. In the vote for party leader, Lagunes and her allies in Puebla \u2014 a drive southeast from Mexico City \u2014 were supporting the challenger, a senator who promised to return the party to its conservative roots. But the incumbent was backed by Puebla\u2019s powerful governor, Rafael Moreno Valle. One of Mexico\u2019s rising political stars, Moreno Valle is close to Mexico\u2019s president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, and has forged an alliance between PAN and Nieto\u2019s centrist Partido Revolucionario Institucional, or PRI, long the dominant force in Mexican politics. Since winning the governorship in 2010, Moreno Valle\u2019s opponents say, his ambitions have grown, and he has resorted to increasingly harsh measures to keep Puebla state \u2014 including members of his own party \u2014 under control. \u201cIn the beginning, the governor was and respectful,\u201d Rafael Micalco, a former leader of PAN in Puebla state, told me. \u201cWhen he became governor, he transformed. Now he controls the party through threats. \u201d This race to retain control of the party leadership in 2014 was a crucial test for the governor, who was rumored to be considering a run for Mexico\u2019s presidency in 2018. (This past September, Moreno Valle publicly announced his intent to run.) Clashes between the two camps were especially intense in Puebla, where backers of the challenger, Ernesto Cordero, claimed that the governor was using public money to support the incumbent, Gustavo Madero, though the governor\u2019s office has denied these charges. Shortly before the election, Madero\u2019s campaign manager said that Cordero\u2019s side was trying to undermine the legitimacy of the process. \u201cTheir strategy is clear from the outset,\u201d he said in an interview with a Mexican magazine. \u201c\u2019u2009\u2018If I win, good. If not, I was cheated. \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d After Lagunes\u2019s call on Election Day, her colleagues rushed from the restaurant back to their local headquarters, a hotel conference room that they had nicknamed \u201cthe bunker. \u201d All morning, they had been trying to reach their field network, a group of 40 Cordero canvassers who were working to get out the vote in Puebla state. But the field network seemed to have gone dark. Few of the canvassers were even answering their phones. Hackers, the team concluded, must have found the list of the canvassers\u2019 names and phone numbers \u2014 widely circulated by email within the campaign \u2014 and begun to intimidate them. \u201cThe day before,\u201d the consultant told me, the field network was \u201cmotivated and eager to do this work. After the hack, it was very hard to reach them. The few who did answer said that they had received phone calls saying that their lives were at stake. They were worried that if they went out, they or their families would get hurt. \u201d According to another worker on Cordero\u2019s campaign, who also requested anonymity, citing fear of reprisal, the message to the canvassers was simple and direct: \u201cWe know who you are. If you don\u2019t want any trouble, shut down your cellphone and stop your activity. \u201d The worker added: \u201cIt\u2019s an authoritarian regime. \u201d Madero won the election, with 57 percent of the 162, 792 votes cast over all. In Puebla, his margin was substantially larger, roughly 74 percent. Cordero\u2019s team decided not to contest the result. They had suspicions about how they were hacked. But it would be another year before any evidence emerged. Their political enemies, leaked documents seemed to show, had built a spying operation using software made by an Italian firm called Hacking Team \u2014 just one of many private companies that, largely below public notice, have sprung up to aid governments in surveilling the private lives of individual citizens. The industry claims that its products comply with local laws and are used to fight crime and terror. But in many countries around the world, these tools have proved to be equally adept at political espionage. On average, an American office worker sends and receives roughly 120 emails per day, a number that grows with each passing year. The ubiquity and utility of email has turned it into a record of our lives, rich with mundane and potentially embarrassing details, stored in a perpetual archive, accessible from anywhere on earth and protected, in some cases, by nothing more than a single password. In the case of Violeta Lagunes, her email login represented a point of vulnerability, a seam where the digital walls protecting her campaign were at the mercy of her human judgment \u2014 specifically, whether she could determine if a message from an apparently reputable source was real or fake. Nearly two years later, John Podesta, chairman of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, was faced with a similar judgment call. An email warned him that someone in Ukraine had tried to access his Gmail account and asked him to click on a button and reset his password. His senior adviser forwarded the email to one of the campaign\u2019s technology experts. \u201cThis is a legitimate email,\u201d he replied, in what the expert later would clarify was a simple typing error on his part he meant to say it was not legitimate. \u201cThe gmail one is REAL,\u201d the senior adviser wrote to Podesta and another aide. And so, like Lagunes, Podesta fell into a trap. The button appeared to lead to an official Google page, but it was in fact a meticulously personalized fake, with a domain address linked to a remote cluster of atolls in the South Pacific. The details were designed to trick Podesta into entering his password. This technique is known as \u201cspear phishing. \u201d It is an especially potent weapon against companies and political organizations because it needs to succeed only one time, against one target. After that, attackers can use the trusted identity of the first compromised account to more easily lure colleagues into opening infected attachments or clicking on malicious links. Not only will a working email password yield years of intraoffice chatter, invoices, bills and confidential memos it can often be leveraged into control of other personal accounts \u2014 Twitter, Facebook, Amazon \u2014 and even access to company servers and internet domains. The Podesta and Lagunes episodes are far from the only cases in which hackers have used information from stolen emails as a weapon against an entire institution. The 2009 \u201cClimategate\u201d incident, which exposed troves of emails from prominent climate researchers, began when hackers remotely broke into servers at a British university with the help of illicitly obtained passwords. The 2014 hack of internal Sony files, which American officials attributed to the North Korean government, began with a series of emails that attackers then used to dig deeper into Sony\u2019s servers. Each hack yielded the most private thoughts and deeds from the members of each respective organization: their blunt insults, their quashed dissents, their plans, their smarmy flattery, all chronicled in time down to the hundredth of the second when the author clicked \u201csend. \u201d In an earlier era, the hackers might have had to engage in riskier behavior, like bribery or burglary. Now, in many cases, all they had to do was send along a link. The White House, C. I. A. and F. B. I. have all claimed that, based on classified evidence, they can trace the hacks of Podesta\u2019s email account (and other hacks of people close to the Clinton campaign) back to the Russian government. But with the rise of private firms like Hacking Team, penetrating the email accounts of political opponents does not require the kind of money and expertise available to major powers. A website called Insider Surveillance lists more than a dozen companies selling ethical malware, including Hacking Team and the German firms FinFisher and Trovicor. Compared with conventional arms, surveillance software is subject to few trade controls a recent attempt by the United States to regulate it under a pact called the Wassenaar Arrangement failed. \u201cThe technology is morally neutral,\u201d says Joel Brenner, a former inspector general of the National Security Agency. \u201cThe same program that you use to monitor your babysitter might be used by Bashar Assad or Abdel Fattah to keep track of whomever they don\u2019t like. \u201d Hacking Team has fewer than 50 employees, but it has customers all over the world. According to internal documents, its espionage tool, which is called the Remote Control System, or R. C. S. can be licensed for as little as $200, 000 a year \u2014 well within the budget of a provincial strongman. After it has been surreptitiously installed on a target\u2019s computer or phone, the Remote Control System can invisibly eavesdrop on everything: text messages, emails, phone and Skype calls, location data and so on. Whereas the N. S. A. \u2019s programs grab data in transit from switching rooms and undersea cables, the R. C. S. acquires it at the source, right off a target\u2019s device, before it can be encrypted. It carries out an invisible, digitized equivalent of a . The United States government is almost certainly the world\u2019s most formidable repository of hacking talent, but its most powerful cyberweapons are generally reserved for intelligence agencies and the military. This might explain why, according to company documents, at least two federal agencies have been Hacking Team clients: the F. B. I. beginning in 2011, and the Drug Enforcement Administration, beginning in 2012. The F. B. I. contract paid Hacking Team more than $700, 000 the D. E. A. appears to have used the software to go after targets in Colombia. Documents show that the company has also sold its software to some of the world\u2019s most repressive governments. Some, like those of Honduras, Ethiopia, Bahrain, Morocco, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, are Western allies. Other countries, like Uzbekistan and Turkey, have a more troubled relationship. A few are openly hostile to the West. Between 2012 and 2014, Hacking Team was paid nearly one million euros by the government of Sudan, a United state sponsor of terrorism. Even more notable, in light of recent events, is the relationship that Hacking Team carried on with the F. S. B. one of Russia\u2019s main intelligence agencies. As with Puebla, Hacking Team used a middleman, a research agency called Kvant, to handle its sales to Russia. Between 2012 and 2014, the agency paid Hacking Team 451, 000 euros to license the Remote Control System. Hacking Team claims that it draws the line at customers who commit \u201cgross abuses\u201d and that it sells exclusively to governments operating within the laws of their own countries. In at least one case, David Vincenzetti, Hacking Team\u2019s founder and chief executive, told a salesman to hold off on a potential Mexican client. \u201cWe sell to official, governmental LEAs\u201d \u2014 agencies \u2014 \u201cand security agencies ONLY,\u201d Vincenzetti wrote in an email. But at other times, a more casual attitude prevailed inside the company. \u201cIf one sells sandwiches to Sudan, he is not subject, as far as my knowledge goes, to the law,\u201d one Hacking Team lawyer wrote in an internal email. \u201cHacking Team should be treated like a sandwich vendor. \u201d When asked about its arrangements in various countries, the company responded that it \u201cdoes not comment on confidential business dealings. \u201d Its American spokesman, Eric Rabe, did tell me that neither Russia nor Sudan is a current Hacking Team customer. (The relationships, Rabe wrote, ended in 2014, Russia because \u201cthe Putin government evolved from one considered friendly to the West to a more hostile regime\u201d and Sudan \u201cbecause of concerns about the country\u2019s ability to use the system in accordance with the H. T. contract. \u201d) Separately, the company confirmed that the state of Puebla was, in fact, a former client. Until recently, most of what was known about the world of private surveillance companies was a matter of hearsay and speculation. Industry players kept a low profile, operating discreetly from rented offices and meeting potential customers in person a few times a year at carefully screened trade shows. This is why it was so notable when, in July 2015, an unusual tweet appeared in Hacking Team\u2019s Twitter feed. \u201cSince we have nothing to hide,\u201d it read, \u201cwe\u2019re publishing all our emails, files and source code. \u201d Then came another tweet, with links to a downloadable file called Hacked Team. The file was huge, 420 gigabytes of material scraped from Hacking Team\u2019s internal servers. Inside were 33 folders containing the company\u2019s contracts, payroll documents, invoices, legal memos, records and a cache of email correspondence from the chief executive on down. Hacking Team had itself been hacked. WikiLeaks pounced on the breach and quickly uploaded the emails into a searchable database. Anyone with an internet connection could now read the chief executive joking about how his company was in the business of selling \u201cthe evilest technology on earth. \u201d You could browse Hacking Team\u2019s source code, including one line using \u201cbomb_blueprints. pdf\u201d as a placeholder for files that might be found on a target\u2019s device. On Reddit, an online peanut gallery formed around the online habits of one Hacking Team engineer and his own notably weak passwords \u2014 HTPassword! P4ssword, Passw0rd. But the most damaging exposures in the leak by far were Hacking Team\u2019s client list and the names of some of the clients\u2019 targets. In South Korea, newspapers focused on evidence suggesting that Hacking Team\u2019s software had helped the nation\u2019s intelligence service rig an election after the leak, one agent who had reportedly used the system there committed suicide. In Ecuador, a magazine found an email with seven phone numbers that the government appeared to have targeted with the R. C. S. Three belonged to lawmakers a fourth to the mayor of Quito all four were members of the opposition party. With the source code for the Remote Control System now public, the company and its clients had to stop using it temporarily. By the end of the year, though, Hacking Team had updated its product and was trying to rebuild its reputation. I was curious whether a company that profited from online breaches could recover from its own. Eric Rabe, the American spokesman, sounded eager to meet me for coffee in Philadelphia. A grandfather and former anchor, he exudes credibility. \u201cIf you disagree with someone on the internet,\u201d he said, of the Hacked Team files, with a wave of his hand, \u201cthere\u2019s no need to have a debate. Just go destroy them. \u201d A couple of months later, I went to Milan to visit Hacking Team\u2019s headquarters, a stately gray apartment building with boxes of limp flowers adorning a few of its sooty sills. Waiting to demonstrate the company\u2019s software were Rabe Philippe Vinci, a company vice president and Alessandro Scarafile, a young engineer. Scarafile had gathered a Dell desktop computer and three smartphones: iPhone, BlackBerry and Android. The screen from his own laptop, which represented the console of a client intelligence agency, was projected on the wall. Several icons represented the various streams of data that could potentially be acquired by gaining control of the target\u2019s computer: images from cameras, sound from mikes, screenshots, detailed records of applications opened and bitcoins transferred, a continuous log of location with latitude and longitude, and logs of address books, calendars, phone calls, Skype calls and passwords, as well as websites visited. A key logger recorded every key that was pressed. It was a lot to keep track of. Two other views, called \u201cline of events\u201d and \u201cline of actions,\u201d assembled the information into chronological order. Scarafile, who was playing both the customer and the target, or \u201cbad guy,\u201d turned on the Dell. Judging by the background on the desktop, a gothic scene framed by castlelike silhouettes, our target seemed to be planning a terrorist attack from Transylvania. There are three methods, Scarafile explained, for getting the Remote Control System onto a target\u2019s device. Customers can gain physical access to the device and then infect it with a USB stick or memory card. They can beam the R. C. S. in over a network. Or they can send the customer an email and get him to click on an infected attachment \u2014 usually a file from a program like Microsoft Word or PowerPoint. Scarafile did not mention a fourth method, one described by Hacking Team\u2019s critics and referred to in its internal emails: the installation of the R. C. S. through a more elaborate process called \u201cnetwork injection,\u201d which is said to involve pinpointing the target\u2019s exact location on the internet, observing the person as he orders up, say, a YouTube cat video, and then serving up a doctored version of the same page, one with the desired cat video playing in the foreground \u2014 YouTube logo and all \u2014 as the R. C. S. discreetly rolls in past the digital gates. Whatever the method of infection, the malicious code, known as an \u201cagent,\u201d then communicates with its masters anonymously, its dispatches routed through a series of dedicated servers scattered around the world. Even if the target gets suspicious and figures out that something is wrong, this chain of servers makes it nearly impossible for him to figure out exactly who is using Hacking Team\u2019s product to spy on him. For the demo, Scarafile opted for the third method, which he referred to as \u201ca bit of social engineering. \u201d Using the customer\u2019s computer, he sent the target an email with a Word file attached. Then he returned to the target\u2019s computer and on it, just as Lagunes had clicked on the link in her inbox. \u201cFrom now on,\u201d he said, \u201cthis system is currently infected, or monitored, by the Remote Control System. \u201d It would remain so even if the suspect turned off his machine or logged out. On the timeline, the target appeared as a stubbly lout in an undershirt, named \u201cJimmy Page . .. head of the terrorist cell. \u201d Using Jimmy Page\u2019s Dell, Scarafile logged into Page\u2019s Gmail, Facebook and Twitter. He opened up Skype, perused Page\u2019s criminal colleagues (Don Corleone, Harry Potter, Keyser Soze) and left one of them a voice mail message from Page\u2019s phone. Accessing a USB drive attached to the infected computer, Scarafile opened an encrypted file that turned out to contain an order to \u201ckill David Vincenzetti. \u201d R. C. S. captured it all, including periodic snapshots of Scarafile, as Page, at work. \u201cI don\u2019t like the words \u2018inject\u2019 and \u2018infect,\u2019\u2019u2009\u201d Vinci, the vice president, said. \u201cR. C. S. is deploying the agent into the device of the target because you want to monitor some of his activities. Exactly the way that law enforcement is listening to some of your phone calls, right?\u201d Rabe had told me that Vincenzetti was \u201ca fighter,\u201d and his combative side was apparent from a collage of magazine clippings and printouts taped to the wall beside his desk \u2014 a sort of mood board, like those used in the advertising industry to gather inspiration before the unveiling of a new brand. Vincenzetti\u2019s mood board, though, wasn\u2019t about sneakers or cola. It was about the global struggle for power, which he seemed to envision as one big conflict, a battle between the good guys and the bad guys. On the good side was a photo of the bell that aspiring Navy SEALs can ring should they want to quit the program during Hell Week, and a quote from another entrepreneur that \u201cbusiness is war. \u201d On the bad side, Vincenzetti had taped up a satellite image showing one of the hottest zones of international tension, the artificial islands rising in the South China Sea, a line of terrestrial pawns advancing China\u2019s sphere of influence. Beside it was a chart about Iran, depicting how the country could continue to advance its nuclear program despite the recent deal. \u201cI think the Iran deal is just terrible,\u201d Vincenzetti said, and then added, sarcastically, \u201cOh, it\u2019s such a very peaceful expansion. Very peaceful. \u201d \u201cThat is not an official company position,\u201d Rabe interjected. Vincenzetti, now 48, is a familiar type \u2014 a ferociously competitive, driven entrepreneur whose existence is organized around his work. He has a wife, who was born in Morocco, and no children. His small, eyes can make him seem sleepily blas\u00e9. On the morning we met at Hacking Team\u2019s offices, he wore jeans, a cardigan and a striped shirt, unbuttoned to midchest. He seemed more comfortable on his feet than sitting down. As we talked in a conference room, he periodically leapt to his feet and stalked around the table, considering in turn the espresso machine, the view from the window, a case of bottled water. \u201cIf I wanted to break into this room, how would I do it?\u201d he asked. \u201cThere is a door, and there are two windows. \u201d He pressed his hands against the glass panes. \u201cThe perimeter is the first thing you must secure,\u201d he continued. Securing data was what he did earlier in his career. Now he had moved on. \u201cIf you cannot break into a bank, you cannot protect a bank. So when you are in security, really there is no difference between thinking offensively and defensively. \u201d In the Vincenzetti\u2019s parents, a salesman and a schoolteacher, bought him a Commodore 64, one of the earliest personal computers. He soon created a clone, a Tron game and a adventure game. As a student at the University of Milan in the \u201990s, he became fascinated by cryptography he corresponded with programmers around the world about new cryptographic theories and wrote code for email encryption. In his senior year, he was appointed to administer the university\u2019s internal network, a post that was usually reserved for a graduate student. Vincenzetti remembers these early days as a time when \u201ceverything was free and no one was trying to harm you. We were wide open and accessible. All the best were called hackers, and I was a hacker. \u201d Vincenzetti left university early and founded three companies, all of them focused on defensive cybersecurity. After he founded Hacking Team in 2003, he tried to sell his services to Italian police agencies but found them skeptical that Mafiosi and other criminals would ever bother to encrypt their communications. In Italy, the police were also used to getting whatever they needed through wiretaps, arranged with varying degrees of formality through their contacts at telecommunications firms. But after the 2004 Madrid train bombings, which were coordinated via cellphones and the internet, police officers and intelligence agents not just in Italy but all across Europe became interested in contracting with vendors, part of an emerging arms race over encryption. The growth of Skype made it easy for users to encrypt their communications, and the authorities were eager to pay for countermeasures like the Remote Control System. Singapore, Hacking Team\u2019s first client, signed on in 2008. The company\u2019s Middle Eastern business took off in 2011, a boom that coincided with the beginning of the Arab Spring. By then, Hacking Team had entered a growth phase, its business driven in part by demand among governments for surveillance tools. According to two former employees, the company held talks with Col. Muammar \u2019s chief security officer, who wanted to build a countrywide scheme that could be embedded in every Libyan cellphone. (Rabe would not confirm or deny that this meeting occurred, and added: \u201cThe company often receives requests to provide services that it does not have available or would sell. \u201d) The United Nations, which prohibits the export of \u201celectronic weaponry\u201d to Sudan, has investigated Hacking Team\u2019s activities there. Nineteen members of the Italian Parliament signed a petition raising the question of whether the Egyptian government might have used the R. C. S. to track Giulio Regeni, a Italian student who appears to have been under government surveillance and whose mutilated body turned up on the side of a road in Egypt last year. Hacking Team\u2019s software has not been connected to the case, but the company has done business with the current Egyptian regime. As part of the controversy, the Italian government temporarily revoked Hacking Team\u2019s global export license, so that for several months the company had to file a separate application for each of its customers outside the European Union. (When I brought up the Regeni case with Rabe, he called the dead student \u201cthis Italian national who got himself killed in Egypt. \u201d He cited Hacking Team\u2019s official policy \u2014 the company neither knows nor desires to know the identities of the people its customers choose to target. \u201cThere is no evidence that Hacking Team\u2019s software had anything to do with Regeni\u2019s demise,\u201d Rabe said.) All Hacking Team customers sign contracts agreeing to comply with local laws. The company says that it vets potential customers and studies reports from journalists and groups, looking for \u201cobjective evidence or credible concerns\u201d that its products are being abused. But when it comes to Hacking Team\u2019s own interactions with customers, leaked documents suggest that employees have sometimes turned a blind eye. In the case of the Puebla government and other Latin American customers, Hacking Team employees appeared to ignore warnings suggesting that the Remote Control System was being used to gather intelligence on the political opposition. On multiple occasions, customers emailed Hacking Team attachments with content, including polling data, party registration forms and invitations addressed to and signed by elected officials. Rather than ask what these files had to do with fighting crime and drug trafficking, Hacking Team members simply emailed them back, as requested, with an embedded \u201cexploit,\u201d turning the document into a surveillance tool to be used against whomever it was sent on to. Asked about these cases, Rabe replied that customers \u201care not supposed to be using it for political purposes, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable to expect that an Italian computer programmer,\u201d i. e. a support technician, \u201cwould have seen these files and known what was going on. . .. I think that\u2019s a stretch, that an Italian software guy could know that an individual is a dissident. \u201d Hacking Team\u2019s most persistent critic is Citizen Lab, a research group at the University of Toronto\u2019s Munk School of Global Affairs. Before the Hacked Team leak, Citizen Lab documented cases in which Hacking Team software turned up on the devices of activists in Morocco and the United Arab Emirates, as well as an journalist in Alexandria, Va. Ronald Deibert, Citizen Lab\u2019s director, told me that Hacking Team \u201cis a company that appears to have no internal controls on abuse of its products. \u201d When I asked Vincenzetti about this, he said that Citizen Lab was motivated by money, noting that the group won a grant a week after publishing a report on Hacking Team\u2019s sales to Ethiopia. \u201cTheir identity,\u201d he said, \u201cis: \u2018I am the defender of free speech, I am the defender of liberty and democracy.\u2019 O. K. So am I. So is every rational guy. \u201d If Citizen Lab really cared about good and evil, he said, it would be fighting China and Iran. Almost immediately after the Hacked Team documents went online, they were being pored over by R3D, a Mexico group. Luis Fernando Garc\u00eda, R3D\u2019s director, says that intimidation and online surveillance have increased under Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s presidency, and he took notice when Citizen Lab, in 2014, released a report that traced a chain of servers associated with Hacking Team that routed data through Hong Kong, London, Amsterdam and Atlanta before terminating somewhere inside Mexico. Exactly who was on the receiving end of the traffic and what they were doing with it was unknown at the time, but now R3D\u2019s team recognized that this could be their chance to find out. Shortly thereafter, R3D published three invoices from the Hacked Team cache showing that one state government \u2014 that of Jalisco, on the Pacific Coast \u2014 had paid the company nearly half a million euros for the Remote Control System. Soon other documents were found in the leak to implicate several more states, including Puebla, though most of the states denied ever using the software. (Jalisco later admitted to purchasing the system, which it claimed was for its prosecutor\u2019s office.) The story failed to get much traction in the Mexican press, except in Puebla, after R3D connected with Lado B, a small collective there. The site\u2019s name translates to \u201cB Side,\u201d as in the back of a hit single \u2014 symbolizing its dedication to telling stories that would otherwise go untold. Lado B\u2019s editor, Ernesto Aroche, was not surprised that Puebla\u2019s government had been using the Remote Control System. In Moreno Valle\u2019s six years as governor there, he has spent lavishly on new surveillance systems, including multiple \u201csecurity arches,\u201d structures that scrutinize traffic with video cameras and and whose cost had raised some questions in the local press. Beginning in 2013, Aroche began noticing solicitations on the website for hidden cameras and other spying equipment. When he filed a request about them, the government\u2019s form response indicated that these orders had never been filled, but Aroche was skeptical, given the mounting evidence that Moreno Valle\u2019s administration had begun using its security apparatus for political purposes. There were periodic of homes belonging to dissident politicians and journalists, with the burglars sometimes taking little besides their victims\u2019 laptops. Politicians would answer calls from unknown numbers, only to hear their own taped conversations played back to them. Another journalist, Fernando Maldonado, received an unmarked envelope full of what were purportedly transcripts of 400 private phone calls made by Puebla politicians. As Aroche and R3D sifted through the Hacked Team file dump, they discovered that the files on Puebla had more detail than those dealing with Hacking Team\u2019s other Mexican accounts. The Puebla client often wrote emails asking for help with infecting a particular document with a malicious virus. Some of these came from an account \u2014 soporteuiamx@gmail. com \u2014 that also appears in many of Hacking Team\u2019s internal support tickets. One of those tickets documents a client\u2019s request for help in infecting an attachment: an invitation to attend an event for a Mexican political organization, signed by Violeta Lagunes and addressed to another party colleague opposed to the governor. Aroche interviewed politicians and journalists who were on the receiving end of the infected emails contained in the Hacked Team trove. According to a 2015 article that Lado B published in conjunction with a politics website, the Puebla group sent Hacking Team at least 47 requests to infect specific files that it would then forward on to their targets. Almost all of those files had to do with political issues. Going through the Hacked Team materials, Aroche found the name of a Puebla government employee who seemed to be working within the spying operation. \u201cBefore, we had been talking about ghosts,\u201d Aroche told me. \u201cNow, we could prove it. We started putting names on the actors. \u201d More than a year later, there have been no political repercussions for the governor or his allies in Puebla. I met Aroche this fall at the Lado B offices, a small room facing a courtyard in a crumbling stone building from Puebla\u2019s colonial days. The only suggestion of Lado B\u2019s presence was a small sticker on the window. Inside, Aroche was thumbing through an envelope of documents that he had wrung out of the state government. Two redacted contracts signed by Puebla officials showed an arrangement between the state government and a company called Sym Servicios Integrales, which Aroche\u2019s reporting had identified as an intermediary for Hacking Team. The details of what had been purchased were redacted. \u201cThese contracts demonstrate that the Puebla government had a commercial relationship with this company,\u201d Aroche said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if they\u2019re a little bit stained \u2014 I dropped some coffee on them. \u201d (Sym Servicios Integrales says it \u201cnever sold H. T. technology to the state of Puebla. \u201d) In a brief written statement from Sagrario Conde Valerio, a spokeswoman, the government of Puebla denied allegations of spying and claimed that \u201cno relationship exists nor has ever existed between the government of Puebla and the company \u2018Hacking Team. \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d The government declined to respond further to a list of questions. But a former official from Moreno Valle\u2019s administration claimed to me that more than $1 million was being diverted from the state budget each year to fund the unit. Documents from the Hacked Team archive indicate that Hacking Team received an order from the government of Puebla for 415, 000 euros in the spring of 2013, and that Hacking Team booked hotel rooms for three of its associates who traveled to Puebla in May of that year. Some of the R. C. S. training, I was told, took place in a green building on a residential street. When I visited the purported site this fall, lettering above the door said that the building was once a school. Now it had bars across the door and mirrored windows. Neighbors told me it had been abandoned for several months. \u201cPeople would come and go,\u201d one woman said. \u201cThey were very secretive. They would drop off equipment, take away equipment. Then one day, about a year ago, they came and took everything away and left. \u201d Another neighbor said that he often saw a car parked in front of the house and a man with a limp entering and leaving \u2014 a former Mexican intelligence agent, according to someone who was present during the Hacking Team training. Mexico is Hacking Team\u2019s biggest export market, accounting for nearly six million euros in sales, according to leaked documents. Ostensibly, the Remote Control System is intended for fighting criminals and drug traffickers there. (\u201cThere have been reports that the software was used in the apprehension of Chapo Guzman,\u201d Rabe told me, referring to the Mexican drug lord. \u201cI can\u2019t confirm it. \u201d) The files indicate that at least seven other Mexican state governments were Hacking Team clients, but because they did not use email to the same extent as Puebla, their activities are harder to track. Multiple former Hacking Team employees told me that abuses of the software were not limited to Puebla. One former employee described having the system set up inside a mayor\u2019s office. Katitza Rodr\u00edguez, director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says that Mexican law allows for interception of communication, like the wiretapping of phone lines, but it does not grant precise legal authority to use new, powerful invasive tools like those created by Hacking Team. And she argues that it is much more dangerous in Mexico than in other Western countries, where checks and balances are stronger. \u201cThis is much more intrusive than the interception of a phone call,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are not only listening they are taking over your laptop. Mexico needs to have a full debate in Congress about what legal safeguards are needed for this kind of surveillance or if the government should be using it at all. \u201d The Hacked Team files indicate that in Hacking Team opened an American subsidiary and leased office space in Reston, Va. a drive from the C. I. A. \u2019s headquarters. The company drew up a \u201cU. S. action plan,\u201d calling for a significant North American expansion, with new hires and rounds of pitches to the Department of Justice, the United States military and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Hacking Team was also targeting another potentially lucrative market: American state and local governments. It pitched the R. C. S. to agencies in San Bernardino, Calif. Washington New York Fort Lauderdale and Orlando. In a risk assessment commissioned by the company, lawyers advised that such sales were probably legal, so long as the product was provided \u201cat a distance\u201d from actual investigations and used \u201cin the normal course of government operations. \u201d American expansion by companies like Hacking Team may not face much resistance from the federal government, which is becoming more accepting of electronic surveillance as part of normal police work. Last year, the Justice Department successfully changed the rules of criminal procedure, making it easier for federal agents to hack into multiple computers with a single warrant. Senator Steve Daines of Montana, who tried to block the change, complained that it gives \u201cunlimited power for unlimited hacking. \u201d In a 2014 address, now referred to in cybersecurity circles as his \u201cGoing Dark\u201d speech, the F. B. I. \u2019s director, James Comey, argued that the encryption built into Apple products posed a threat to public safety \u2014 enabling not only terrorism but also drug trafficking, child abuse and . Instead of \u201ca safe that can\u2019t be cracked,\u201d Comey wanted technology companies to lend him the combination. \u201cThe law hasn\u2019t kept pace with technology, and this disconnect has created a significant problem,\u201d Comey said. \u201cWe call it \u2018going dark. \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d As the United States government has argued for weaker protections around personal communications, American businesses have been spreading more powerful surveillance tools around the world. Many foreign agencies already buy products from SS8 \u2014 a company backed by the storied firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers \u2014 as well as from the Harris Corporation, a $13 billion company based in Florida and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. At least 25 American police departments have used Harris\u2019s Stingray device, which mimics cellphone towers and can intercept cellphone calls within 200 meters. All known sales of Stingrays to local law enforcement have been authorized by the F. B. I. which has since fought in court to keep those sales secret. In Baltimore alone, Stingrays have been used more than 4, 000 times, in routine drug investigations. Much less is known about another Harris product, the advanced Hailstorm, which is also sold to local police departments. Hailstorm is reportedly capable of implanting malware that can take control of a targeted phone, much like Hacking Team\u2019s R. C. S. The Hacked Team documents that offer the most revealing view of the company\u2019s ethos happen to be the most public ones. For years, as often as two or three times a day, Vincenzetti sent mass emails to hundreds of his business contacts. The recipients included numerous members of the United States military and intelligence community, as well as government employees from the city of Cincinnati and the Internal Revenue Service. In these messages, Vincenzetti often addresses this audience collectively as \u201cgents. \u201d The news he cites is a reminder of how the geopolitical winds have been blowing in favor of Hacking Team and other allies of law and order. In Vincenzetti\u2019s world, the system is always, as George Tenet famously said about . 11 intelligence, \u201cblinking red\u201d: the imploding Middle East a restive, Russia battalions of jihadis roaming around Europe with their encrypted thumb drives and expertise. Against this backdrop of danger, concerns about human rights are na\u00efve at best. Vincenzetti\u2019s emails vividly exploit this sense of danger and alarm. He writes about shadowy gangs of Iranian hackers using the #JeSuisCharlie hashtag to inject malware into French laptops. He celebrates the conviction of Ross Ulbricht, a. k. a. the Dread Pirate Roberts, creator of the Silk Road website. After the arrests of two Uzbek men in Brooklyn for telling informants that they wanted to join up with ISIS, Vincenzetti writes of \u201ca very serious terrorist plot on American soil foiled. \u201d He went on to tap out this sales pitch: The following day, he gave a few more hints: The tone of Vincenzetti\u2019s sales patter was strangely upbeat, especially considering his dire forecasts. It was almost as if he were in the business of selling microwave ovens or sandwiches, not tools through which the private lives of criminals (and whoever else) could be fully laid bare. Vincenzetti\u2019s unstated equation \u2014 privacy is secrecy, and secrecy is terrorism \u2014 is less controversial than it might appear. A supportive echo can be heard in many public statements from American officials, which Vincenzetti often cut and pasted into his mass emails. The former attorney general Eric Holder called for \u201cinvestigative and prosecutorial tools that allow us to be . \u201d When Comey warned that \u201cencryption threatens to lead all of us to a very dark place,\u201d Vincenzetti forwarded it along approvingly, with the tagline: \u201cWe DO have an answer to many if not all of his concerns. \u201d And when, in May 2015, Comey warned of a \u201cthreat\u201d that had \u201cmorphed\u201d into \u201ca chaotic spider web,\u201d Vincenzetti sent word to his \u201cgents\u201d as well. One month later, an anonymous hack revealed Hacking Team\u2019s own invisible spider web, and one year later, during the to Election Day, came the internal emails of the Democratic Party. By then it was clear that tools for digital burglary had spread well beyond the hands of regular police officers. Comey had argued for weaker safes Vincenzetti was selling longer crowbars. They could be used to chase Jimmy Page, arrest Chapo Guzman, fight crime, smear a political opponent or just keep tabs on someone, anyone. To be hidden is to be a terrorist \u2014 this was the heart of his pitch. Any digital redoubt that could resist being pried open was a public risk and a private opportunity.",

        "text": "While many of us weren\u2019t paying attention, some credit card bonuses became so large that the analysts at Bernstein Research wondered in November if the industry was afflicted with temporary insanity. One particular bit of madness \u2014 a Chase offer that effectively puts $1, 500 in your pocket without a lot of effort, if you are a relatively big spender \u2014 is close to ending, and many people have just a few more days to take advantage of it. But the mere existence of bonuses on top of the points and perks that come with everyday spending raises a number of questions for consumers. Even if you thought you had had enough of to get the best deals, shouldn\u2019t you at least grab those 15 bills if you have the means? Or might the offers actually get better? And is it time to bet against the stocks of the maniac bankers who are tossing around offers like this? CHASE, TODAY? First things first: That giant bonus comes from the Chase Sapphire Reserve card. Here\u2019s how it works (and don\u2019t confuse it with the similarly named Preferred card): If the bank accepts your application, you have three months to spend $4, 000. Once you do, Chase hands over 100, 000 of its proprietary rewards points. Then you can trade them for $1, 500 worth of travel, as long as you book your flights or rooms through Chase. The card has a $450 annual fee, but it gives back $300 of it each year once you purchase at least that amount in travel. It also gives out a generous amount of points \u2014 three per dollar spent \u2014 on travel and dining. Plus, you can swap points for miles on many airlines if you want to take your chances with seat availability in those reward schemes. Other perks include access to some airport lounges and a rebate for fees you pay for TSA PreCheck, the expedited security screening, or Global Entry, which speeds international returns. In cardland, any offer this lucrative tends not to last. This week, Chase said it would cut the bonus in half for anyone who applied online after Jan. 12 or in a branch (which isn\u2019t possible for people in parts of the country where there are no Chase branches) after March 12. To be safe, the company suggests applying online by Jan. 11, before it flips the switch the next day. Why the change of heart on a product Chase introduced last summer? The company always said the bonus was an introductory offer, and the bank\u2019s generosity led to a $200 million to $300 million hit to its earnings. So the window on a good thing is partly closing. So should you take advantage of it while you can? My wife and I both have done it and are glad we did. It has required some mental energy to channel the right amount of spending away from our current card and track the new bills so we don\u2019t end up paying late. But there is nothing that focuses the mind quite like feeling that you are beating the system. This feeling of superiority may be delusional, given the amount of research that suggests that we pay more when we put things on plastic than when we pay with cash. But I consider myself above average in this regard, as we all probably do. Another big question: Does it make sense to stick with the Chase card, or ditch it after the bonuses clear? One useful exercise is to run your spending patterns (which your card company\u2019s website ought to be able to divide into categories like dining, travel and groceries) through creditcardtuneup. com to compare the results with those of a number of leading rewards cards. It\u2019s a great tool, but the site\u2019s operator has its own opinions about how much a Chase point is worth versus the Starwood points that I collect on my primary American Express card. Your mileage may vary if you, say, swap Chase or Starwood points for miles and then redeem them for $10, 000 plane tickets to a faraway country. Think about your goals for the next couple of years and evaluate accordingly. In our household, we are reserving judgment. That is (in part) because Starwood is in the middle of being acquired by Marriott, which faces the challenging task of combining two loyalty programs without driving away frequent travelers. Sometime in the next year or so, we will find out what it is going to do. Standard disclaimers apply here, as always. Don\u2019t carry a balance, since interest charges will generally eat up the value of the rewards and then some. Also, applying for too many cards in a short time could hurt your credit score a bit. IS THE MADNESS CATCHING? Gordon Smith, the chief executive of consumer and community banking at Chase, spent more than 25 years working at American Express, and it was plainly obvious that the bank was aiming Sapphire Reserve squarely at the Amex Platinum card. Indeed, less than two months after the Chase card appeared in August, Amex issued a news release announcing new benefits for Platinum card holders. Here is what it didn\u2019t do, though: offer a bribe to every new customer who wanted one of its cards. Its standard online offer is currently 40, 000 of its own proprietary points, which are 10, 000 fewer than what Chase\u2019s new, lower bonus will be. (Yes, it\u2019s hard to compare the value of different reward currencies, but these two aren\u2019t that far apart, and many consumers never make the distinction and assume they are the same anyhow.) Some American Express customers have been luckier, though. Card industry bloggers report that the company has sometimes made targeted bonus offers of 100, 000 or even 150, 000 points. Leah Gerstner, an American Express spokeswoman, noted that the company had been in the premium card market for more than three decades, implying that it knew a thing or two about appropriate competitive responses to the latest shiny thing. \u201cWhat\u2019s worked for us is a mix of targeted bonuses combined with a range of premium benefits and services,\u201d Ms. Gerstner said. She added that the company had issued \u201crecord levels of new cards\u201d while delivering \u201csustainable\u201d economics to the company. In their report in November, the Bernstein Research analysts dangled the tantalizing possibility that American Express might begin some kind of price war, throwing its own bonuses and privileges at customers. Now that Chase has lowered its bonus, however, Kevin J. St. Pierre, a Bernstein managing director, thinks the chances of that are low. \u201cThey have inertia on their side, with a customer base that is generally satisfied with their product and very satisfied with the service,\u201d he said. \u201cSo how much do they need to tweak to defend that?\u201d PITY NOT THE POOR BANKERS Shareholders (and consumers who are determined to be the least profitable customers of thriving, generous banks) probably shouldn\u2019t panic about the ramifications of the banks\u2019 largess at this point. Chase would not comment about the performance of Sapphire Reserve, owing to the requirement to stay silent before its coming earnings announcement. Still, it almost certainly modeled the possibility that some people would spend their bonus and then stop using the card. The card\u2019s profitability will depend largely on what percentage of cardholders carry a balance \u2014 and how much and for how long. Mr. St. Pierre said he didn\u2019t lose much sleep over a single, card offering from a bank of this size. \u201cThey are so large that they can afford to experiment,\u201d he said. \u201cA few hundred million in any quarter is a cost of doing business, and they\u2019ll use it, learn from it and improve the product from their perspective and move on. \u201d Citi\u2019s own plastic pushers have already done a bit of this. Its competing Prestige card reduced some perks several months back, though it kept a hotel benefit. \u201cOur strategic focus is delivering products and experiences that create long, lasting relationships,\u201d said Chris Fred, head of proprietary products for Citi\u2019s cards unit. Bonus chasers and card churners, it seems, are not particularly welcome. Still, the banks face an existential crisis of sorts. A generation of young adults grew up on debit cards, and banks are going to have to do something to get the millions of them who don\u2019t need to carry a balance to switch to credit anyway. There aren\u2019t a lot of great ways to do it other than throwing bonuses and perks at them. The rest of us can keep an eye on the bonus offers via blogs like The Points Guy and View From the Wing or on forums like FlyerTalk and Reddit\u2019s pages. Then \u2014 when the going gets as good as it\u2019s gotten in recent months and we want to go on a free vacation \u2014 we can sweep in and gleefully pick off the juiciest offers of all.",

        "text": "Queen Elizabeth II made her first public appearance in almost a month on Sunday, allaying concerns about her health after she missed Christmas and New Year\u2019s Day church services because of what Buckingham Palace described as a persistent cold. The queen, who will turn 91 in April, attended services at St. Mary Magdalene Church in Sandringham, England, with Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, and his wife, as well as several members of the Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s family, including her sister, Pippa, and brother, James. Before Sunday, the queen, whose appearances are usually a staple of the holiday season, had not been seen in public since Dec. 9. Her absence on Christmas Day was the first time in 30 years that she had not attended the holiday service. on social media celebrated the queen\u2019s reappearance. \u201cThe Queen has been seen in public,\u201d one Twitter user said. \u201cHuge relief. I can sleep easy in my bed now. \u201d The queen\u2019s came several weeks after a widespread Twitter hoax started by a fake BBC account that convinced many of her fans that she had died. Despite feeling under the weather, the queen managed to record her traditional Christmas broadcast. \u201cThe message of Christmas reminds us that inspiration is a gift to be given as well as received, and that love begins small but always grows,\u201d she said then. \u201cI wish you all a very happy Christmas. \u201d",

        "text": "In an effort to give back to his hometown community in Florida, Carol City, the star Rick Ross decided to fulfill a childhood dream: He bought a Checkers franchise. Why a Checkers? One reason seemed to rise above them all. \u201cThe No. 1 fries in the game,\u201d Mr. Ross says in a video released in December. The video shows Mr. Ross driving around town in his Ford truck, puffing cigars and relating stories from his childhood in the downtrodden community, which is in the Miami area. At a certain point, Mr. Ross begins talking about the burger joint he frequented as a teenager, across the thoroughfare from the carwash where he worked. There was a McDonald\u2019s that was closer, but Checkers, he says, was more affordable. \u201cI made $30 a day from 8 in the morning to 8 at night,\u201d Mr. Ross says. \u201cI went to Checkers. \u201d Checkers does not typically pursue celebrity endorsements. But when Mr. Ross applied to purchase the Carol City franchise last summer, he seemed so genuine in his affection for the chain that Checkers recognized a marketing opportunity as straightforward as a . Still, it did not want a typical campaign. Scott Wakeman, director of marketing for Checkers Restaurants Inc. and the company\u2019s ad firm, Fitzgerald Company in Atlanta, turned to the digital media upstart Woven Digital. The firm has heavy traction among Mr. Ross\u2019s primary audience \u2014 young men \u2014 on the entertainment sites that it owns, like Uproxx, Dime and BroBible. Woven has also specialized in productions that, on the surface, do not feel like ads. To Mr. Wakeman, it seemed like a perfect way to take advantage of Mr. Ross\u2019s charisma and authenticity. \u201cIt just felt like such a unique opportunity,\u201d he said. The video, which is 3 minutes 31 seconds long, was filmed over two days in Carol City in late September, mostly as Mr. Ross drove his truck around. Spliced in is footage of pickup basketball games and bikers popping wheelies. The first mention of Checkers comes about halfway through the video. Checkers invests the bulk of its annual marketing budget, about $20 million, in standard television spots, Mr. Wakeman said. By contrast, the Rick Ross ad has been distributed only on social media channels and Uproxx. But Mr. Wakeman said he believed the unusual authenticity of the video \u2014 and the compelling way Mr. Ross related his story \u2014 would resonate with viewers more than anything Checkers had tried in the past. \u201cWe don\u2019t think of it as an advertisement,\u201d Mr. Wakeman said, adding of Mr. Ross, \u201cWe wanted to create a piece of content that captured his love for the brand. \u201d Last year, Woven teamed up with MillerCoors on a series of short documentary videos that profiled entrepreneurs with expertise in making items like watches and surfboards, or, in one case, doing calligraphy. The series, sponsored by Coors Banquet beer and run across Uproxx, was intended to reach an audience that has become adept at avoiding traditional advertising. According to Brad Feinberg, senior director of media and digital marketing for MillerCoors, it was a success, receiving more than 33 million views. \u201cThis is content that people want to see they\u2019re intrigued by it, they seek it out,\u201d Mr. Feinberg said. \u201cAnd putting it in long form is something you can do in the digital space that is very cost prohibitive in other places. \u201d storytelling might sound incompatible with the attention spans of millennials, but it can have its advantages. Young men in particular have demonstrated a willingness to sit through longer pieces of content if it aligns with their values and gives them something of value in return, said Leah Swartz, senior content specialist for FutureCast, a part of the Barkley agency of Kansas City, Mo. that focuses on research into millennials. Her team considers this a rewriting of the old ABCs of sales. Rather than the mantra \u201calways be closing,\u201d brands must now think about how they can \u201calways be helping. \u201d \u201cYou have to think about helping your consumer, what you\u2019re providing, what benefits you\u2019re giving, how you\u2019re making their lives more fulfilled,\u201d Ms. Swartz said. For Checkers, turning a story about a hit rapper\u2019s upbringing into a selling point for hamburgers and chicken wings was a bit of a gamble, Mr. Wakeman said. In the video, there are only a couple of references to Checkers\u2019 products, such as Mr. Ross\u2019s unequivocal praise of the French fries. But Mr. Wakeman said the documentary format allowed Mr. Ross\u2019s true voice to shine through. \u201cFood and value are our two big brand pillars, and I think they come through in the spot, in a cool way,\u201d Mr. Wakeman said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a script. It was just Rick talking about what he loves\u201d about the place. The video also captures moments of spontaneity. The producers originally intended just to film Mr. Ross outside the Checkers, but on the way there, he sent out a message on Instagram offering free burgers to any fans who wanted to meet him in Carol City. About 200 people showed up, and the cameras rolled as he shook hands and ripped open bags of food. Benjamin Blank, the chief executive of Woven, said the company was not trying to conceal that the video was an advertisement. But he said he thought the content itself was meaningful and captivating enough that viewers ultimately would not mind being sold to. \u201cThere were plenty of things Rick could have gotten involved with from a business standpoint,\u201d Mr. Blank said. \u201cBut his reason for getting involved with Checkers was a great story. \u201d",

        "text": "\u25a0 Robert F. Kennedy Jr. one of the nation\u2019s most prominent skeptics of childhood vaccines, says Donald J. Trump has asked him to lead a vaccine panel. \u25a0 Charlotte Church delivers a pungent \u201cno\u201d to the inaugural committee\u2019s invitation to perform. Inaugural official says they were going for \u201csoft sensuality\u201d anyway. \u25a0 A delay for the confirmation hearing of Mr. Trump\u2019s pick for education secretary, Betsy DeVos. Mr. Trump on Tuesday asked a prominent crusader to lead a new government commission on vaccine safety and scientific integrity, ushering debunked conspiracy theories about the dangers of immunization into the White House. Mr. Trump, who has embraced discredited links between vaccines and autism, has asked Robert F. Kennedy Jr. a nephew of President John F. Kennedy, to be chairman of the commission, Mr. Kennedy said after meeting with the at Trump Tower. Mr. Kennedy\u2019s appointment spread alarm through the medical community, which for years has rejected claims that childhood vaccines are linked to conditions like autism. Medical experts warned Tuesday that Mr. Trump\u2019s actions would endanger children by confusing parents about the need to have them vaccinated. \u201cIt gives it a that I frankly find frightening,\u201d said William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University. He said Mr. Trump and Mr. Kennedy were being fooled by \u201c \u201d theories about vaccines. \u201cThis is going to be a sad struggle as we try to protect as many children as possible,\u201d Mr. Schaffner said. Among his many political pursuits, Mr. Trump picked up the cause a few years back. In 2012, he tweeted: And: These views, to say the least, are not the scientific consensus, any more than scientists believe that climate change is a Chinese plot \u2014 another theory once espoused by the . Charlotte Church can sing in English, Welsh, Latin, Italian and French, but she won\u2019t be doing so in any language for Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. Ms. Church, the Welsh singer who began her public career at the age of 11 in the late 1990s, said on Tuesday that Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural team had reached out to her about performing during the festivities. She was, to put it nicely, less than interested. (Yes, those emoji are what you think they are.) Ms. Church\u2019s wasn\u2019t the only door slamming shut on Mr. Trump\u2019s team on Tuesday. The other belonged to Rebecca Ferguson, a British singer who rose to prominence on the country\u2019s \u201cX Factor\u201d and said she would perform only if she could sing Billie Holiday\u2019s \u201cStrange Fruit. \u201d The inaugural team was apparently less than enthusiastic. Mr. Trump\u2019s team has secured performances by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, the Jackie Evancho and the Radio City Rockettes. They are expected to dribble out more artists soon. Meh, they didn\u2019t want Charlotte Church anyway. Tom Barrack Jr. a close friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s who is planning the inauguration, told reporters in Trump Tower on Tuesday that Mr. Trump was not looking for \u201c \u201d to perform anyway. \u201cWe\u2019re fortunate in that we have the greatest celebrity in the world, which is the \u201d Mr. Barrack said. He added, \u201cso what we\u2019ve done instead of trying to surround him with what people consider is we are going to surround him with the soft sensuality of the place. It\u2019s a much more poetic cadence than having a circuslike celebration that\u2019s a coronation. \u201d \u201cSoft sensuality\u201d is not generally what comes to mind when one thinks of Washington, D. C. in January, but the city is changing. Senate Democrats have been complaining that there are too many hearings for Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees on Wednesday \u2014 at one point there were six scheduled \u2014 and Republicans, eager to get Mr. Trump\u2019s team in place, have relented a bit. They moved Betsy DeVos, his pick for education secretary, to Jan. 17. Ms. DeVos\u2019s wealth and complicated finances have made the process of unraveling her potential conflicts of interest through the Office of Government Ethics a bit more complicated, so she was perhaps the most logical person to bump. The office, in a letter to Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, made it clear that Ms. DeVos\u2019s background check is far from complete, and that it would be inappropriate to move forward without it. Republicans have maintained the date for her vote out of the HELP Committee: Jan. 24. Two military experts told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday that an exception should be made so that James N. Mattis, a recently retired Marine Corps general, can serve as secretary of defense in the Trump administration. The hearing on the importance of civilian control of the military, which was led by Senator John McCain of Arizona, is intended to set the stage for the committee\u2019s confirmation hearing on Mr. Mattis\u2019s nomination on Thursday. Military officers are barred by law from serving as defense secretary unless they have been out of office for seven years. Mr. Mattis retired from the military in May 2013. But in an encouraging sign for his prospects, the lawmakers appeared to be generally receptive to the experts\u2019 arguments. \u201cThe principle of civilian control of the military is precious,\u201d said Eliot A. Cohen, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, who served as State Department counselor during the George W. Bush administration. But Mr. Cohen, who was a \u201cNever Trumper\u201d during the campaign, argued that an exception should be made because Mr. Mattis was a person of integrity and had vital experience at a time when the Pentagon has to contend with multiple threats, and because he might dissuade the incoming administration from acting recklessly. \u201cA Secretary Mattis would be a stabilizing and moderating force, preventing wildly stupid, dangerous and illegal things from happening, and over time helping to steer American foreign and security policy in a sound and sensible direction,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. Kathleen H. Hicks, an expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, also said that it was appropriate to make an exception for Mr. Mattis and praised his character and expertise. \u201cIt should never be considered \u2018time for a general\u2019 to fill the nonelected civilian position in the operational chain,\u201d she said, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s comments in a November interview. \u201cI assess the state of U. S. relations to be strong enough to withstand any risk such a exception, on its own, could pose,\u201d she added. Trump\u2019s transition team is considering asking the deputy defense secretary, Robert Work, to remain in his position at the Pentagon for several months after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, according to an official familiar with the discussions. While no final decision has been made, the official suggested that Mr. Work could provide some initial bureaucratic stability as Mr. Mattis builds his team at the Pentagon. Last month Mr. Trump announced his intention to nominate Vincent Viola as Army secretary. Mr. Work\u2019s consideration was posted on Twitter by Jennifer Griffin of Fox News and also reported by The Washington Post. Mr. Work could not be reached for comment Monday night. This one will hurt. Two prominent lawmakers, Representative John Lewis of Georgia, a civil rights hero, and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, will be the Democrats\u2019 star witnesses against Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee to be attorney general. Mr. Sessions\u2019s nomination to be a federal judge in 1986 was derailed by allegations of racial bias, and he has drawn opposition from groups. Both lawmakers will have their own particular resonance. Mr. Lewis, a lieutenant of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. \u2019s, was beaten bloody on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala. a seminal moment in the civil rights movement. Mr. Booker, the former mayor of Newark, may lack the historical gravitas of Mr. Lewis, but he may hold more weight for one reason: He will be testifying against a fellow senator. He is believed to be the first sitting senator set to testify against a fellow sitting senator \u2014 ever. In a large show of military opposition to reinstating torture, 176 retired officers \u2014 including 33 generals and admirals \u2014 have sent a joint letter to Mr. Trump urging him not to follow through on his campaign vows to bring back waterboarding \u201cand a hell of a lot worse. \u201d The letter, obtained by The New York Times, was dated Jan. 6 and signed by some of the most prominent military figures of the recent era. They included two former Afghanistan war commanders, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal and Gen. John R. Allen, and the Special Operations commander who oversaw the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, Adm. William H. McRaven. Citing their \u201csix thousand years of combined experience\u201d in commanding troops, the retired officers expressed concern \u201cabout statements made during the campaign about the use of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of detainees in U. S. custody,\u201d and they noted that waterboarding and other \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d are illegal under domestic and international law. The officers also called torture both \u201cunnecessary\u201d and \u201ccounterproductive,\u201d adding that it \u201cviolates our core values as a nation. \u201d \u201cOur greatest strength is our commitment to the rule of law and to the principles embedded in our Constitution,\u201d the letter continued. \u201cOur servicemen and women need to know that our leaders do not condone torture or detainee abuse of any kind. \u201d During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump said he would bring back waterboarding and more for the interrogation of terrorism suspects \u2014 contending that \u201ctorture works,\u201d and even \u201cif it doesn\u2019t work, they deserve it anyway. \u201d The letter makes clear that Mr. Mattis, Mr. Trump\u2019s pick for defense secretary, is not alone in recoiling against torture. Those signing also included a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Hugh H. Shelton a former commander of the Central Command, Gen. Joseph Hoar and four former commanders of the Southern Command: Gen. Douglas Fraser, Gen. James T. Hill, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey and Adm. James G. Stavridis, who went on to be the NATO supreme allied commander. The list also included two former directors of the National Security Agency, Gen. Keith Alexander and Adm. Bobby Ray Inman a commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. Charles C. Krulak and chiefs of staff of the Army and the Air Force, Gen. Dennis J. Reimer and Gen. Merrill A. McPeak. In public, President Obama and his top officials have been careful to keep the smiles pasted on their faces when it comes to their successors, but Michael Froman, Mr. Obama\u2019s United States trade representative, will let the smile slip this morning in a speech billed as a \u201cfarewell address. \u201d In prepared remarks, Mr. Froman does not mention Mr. Trump by name, but he leaves little doubt that he disdains the incoming president\u2019s views on trade, particularly Mr. Trump\u2019s opposition to a proposed trade agreement among Pacific Rim nations that Mr. Froman labored on for years. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine why any president would want to abdicate our leadership in the to be responsible for handing the keys of the castle to China, for driving our historic allies and China\u2019s historic rivals into China\u2019s arms,\u201d Mr. Froman\u2019s prepared text reads. Mr. Froman describes Mr. Trump\u2019s opposition to the deal, the central achievement of Mr. Froman\u2019s tenure as United States trade representative, as \u201cthe biggest gift any U. S. president could give China. \u201d",

        "text": "I\u2019m on the verge of giving up trying to explain why Ignacio Mattos\u2019s food is so good. I once wrote that the cooking at his first restaurant, now closed, dabbled in \u201cdeep, surrealist weirdness. \u201d At Estela, the place on Houston Street that put him on the map, I described his food as \u201calmost familiar, but not quite. \u201d What struck me at his most recent restaurant, Caf\u00e9 Altro Paradiso, was \u201cthe inverse relationship between prettiness and deliciousness. \u201d (What I ate was unpretty and highly delicious.) In retrospect, nothing I wrote captured the qualities that made the food compelling. I latched on to visual style because I couldn\u2019t figure out how to explain why the flavors grabbed me the way they did. After spending some time at Flora Bar, which Mr. Mattos opened in October, I\u2019ve started to think that whatever it is that sets his food apart is something you can\u2019t see. It\u2019s a kind of cooking that\u2019s almost invisible. Flora Bar is inside the Met Breuer museum, Marcel Breuer\u2019s blunt and muscular stack of granite and concrete on Madison Avenue in the 70s, regarded as a masterpiece of the brutalist style. \u201cThe taste for its disconcertingly inverted pyramidal mass grows on one slowly,\u201d the architecture critic for The New York Times, Ada Louise Huxtable, wrote in 1966, \u201clike a taste for olives or warm beer. \u201d The food at Flora Bar is much easier to like than warm beer. Under the direction of Jake Nemmers, the executive chef, it comes out of the kitchen in a series of tidily formal circles and squares. The rough edges of the cooking at Altro Paradiso and Estela have been refined, which makes it even more astonishing when the flavors come at you out of nowhere. A simple red disc on a white plate, Flora Bar\u2019s tuna tartare isn\u2019t like any I\u2019ve had before it pops with toasted flax seeds and crunches with fried shallots, neither of which hides the clean, cold taste of chopped yellowfin tuna. Flora Bar does not quite reinvent tuna tartare the way Estela reinvents beef tartare, but it comes closer than you\u2019d think was possible. Steak comes with b\u00e9arnaise and beet hunks. The beets look a little wrinkled, like prunes, and have an uncannily focused flavor. The b\u00e9arnaise is silky and light on the herbs. The steak looks like steak, sliced. It is tender, and the flavor goes on and on as you chew, yet it doesn\u2019t have the stink of beef. Something must have happened to make it so extraordinary, but the answer is not visible. (The beef has been given, among other treatments, a surreptitious marination in fish sauce.) How can a shrimp cocktail hold any surprises? Well, there\u2019s the price, $29, which may be a record. But then there\u2019s the astonishingly fine flavor and texture of the blue shrimp themselves, glossy and appealingly slippery on a bed of ice pebbles. They\u2019re terrific, and so is their dark, uncloying cocktail sauce. Note the name. Flora Bar is, when you get down to it, less a restaurant than a wine bar. The plates are almost all small even the steak, which could pass as a main course, is a far cry from a steakhouse portion. Flora Bar is not trying to be a utilitarian cafe for museum patrons who knocked themselves out taking in Kerry James Marshall\u2019s show upstairs and now want a cheap, filling meal. That job goes to Flora Coffee next door, where you can get sandwiches and pastries during the day. The wine list at Flora Bar is about as exhaustive as any artist\u2019s career retrospective. It contains multitudes, and in three visits, I barely scratched the surface. And I left the shelves and shelves of tempting, knowledgeably chosen spirits mostly untouched, apart from the slug of gin that went into my very soothing Tuxedo No. 2 cocktail. As wine bars go, it\u2019s somewhat stiff. The service can be punctilious in a way that I imagine is meant to appeal to the Upper East Sider, but fans of Estela (and there are many Upper East Siders in that group) may find it slightly . Or Mr. Mattos and his business partner, Thomas Carter, may just be trying to live up to the space. It\u2019s an exceptionally dramatic one, with marble surfaces and banquettes of dark leather and windows the size of billboards that look out on Breuer\u2019s bridge across the moat below Madison Avenue. A sculpture garden when this building still housed the Whitney Museum of American Art, the moat is now an outdoor extension for Flora Bar. I miss the art, but the tables look inviting enough to make me come back when the weather warms up. The menu is part tapas, part sashimi and part something else. On the tapas side, we have wonderfully crunchy croquetas with a soft core of warm raclette, pink shavings of jam\u00f3n Ib\u00e9rico, and a plate of anchovies, three cured in oil and three in brine. The quality is impeccable if you can get over paying $18 for six anchovies. I couldn\u2019t. Representing sashimi, there is shimmering raw seafood, some of it on or under squares of nori. You\u2019re meant to treat the nori like a tortilla. A month ago, the filling in this taco was raw scallops and a salty streak of plum paste, and I was quietly happy. When I went back, the nori covered sticky raw red shrimp and sea urchin, and I went completely giddy. It took me a minute to warm up to another raw dish, the lobster crudo. Raw lobster is not something you naturally want to cuddle up with. Here it is chopped with shiso and molded into a disc, ready to be swabbed in a mayonnaise. It\u2019s refined and almost comforting. As for something else, you tell me how to characterize raclette and golden slices of rutabaga over a thin, buttery tart shell, or an omelet that is in fact cooked in a thin disc, inverted on to the plate down, and then topped with spoonfuls of hackleback caviar, firm trout roe and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. There\u2019s a fine line between simple and dull, and one or two dishes fell on the wrong side. Stracciatella with lemon peel and cubes of fennel struck me as an ordinary burrata salad traveling under an alias. Halibut with wild mushrooms was no more than the sum of its parts, although they were very good parts. Natasha Pickowicz\u2019s desserts sound safe but can be daring. Mandarin sorbet in a kind of cradle made of coconut was served with a yuzu sauce so sour it made me sit up straight. After the initial shock, I loved it. If I\u2019d expected the parfait of chocolate and amarena cherries to be a layered dessert served in a tall glass, like other parfaits, I was wrong. This was chocolate, as dense as ganache, and served in the shape of, you guessed it, a disc.",

        "text": "Looking to the federal government to rein in police excesses can be an exercise in managed expectations. On Friday, Chicago agreed to revamp its police department after the Justice Department found routine use of excessive force, and the mayor said he would negotiate a settlement, known as a consent decree. But that is no guarantee of results \u2014 and not just because the man most likely to be the next attorney general has said he is skeptical of such endeavors. Attempts to force change in police departments have met with mixed success even under the Obama administration, which made police reform a signature issue. It has opened 25 investigations into law enforcement agencies over issues like excessive force, racial bias and poor supervision, issuing reports choking with outrage. Los Angeles, which was under a consent decree for 11 years, is regarded as one of the great success stories. \u201cLos Angeles is a different place today because of the consent decree and the leadership of the department,\u201d said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a Washington think tank. In Detroit, which emerged from a consent decree last year, officer shootings and warrantless arrests have declined significantly. But Pittsburgh, the target of the first consent decree based on a Justice Department finding of a \u201cpattern and practice\u201d of misconduct, later backslid after changes in leadership, said Samuel Walker, a criminal justice professor at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. And while Miami reduced police shootings to zero for 20 months after a federal investigation in 2002 that was later closed with no settlement, the Justice Department in 2013 reinvestigated and found a pattern of excessive force with firearms, underscoring some experts\u2019 view that consent decrees or other settlements are needed for enduring improvements. Last year, Miami settled the 2013 inquiry by agreeing to improve supervision, training and internal investigations. The \u201cpattern and practice\u201d approach developed after the Rodney King beating in Los Angeles in 1991 forced a period of national introspection over how to curb misconduct if individual officers could not be held accountable. A jury\u2019s decision not to convict the four officers charged in the attack on Mr. King incited deadly riots. Since the early attempts, Mr. Walker said, consent decrees have evolved to be more sophisticated and comprehensive. \u201cThe general pattern is that there is some backsliding on some issues,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a case where a department has completely collapsed back to where it was before. \u201d Still, Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama and the nominee for attorney general under Donald J. Trump, called them \u201cdangerous,\u201d writing in 2008 that they \u201cconstitute an end run around the democratic process. \u201d At his confirmation hearing this past week, he softened that critique, saying there were some circumstances that legitimately demanded consent decrees and that those already in place would be enforced. But, Mr. Sessions said, lawsuits could unfairly target whole police departments for the misdeeds of a few bad actors. \u201cThese lawsuits undermine the respect for police officers and create an impression that the entire department is not doing their work consistent with fidelity to law and fairness,\u201d he said. His critique did not extend to how well consent decrees actually work. But experts say that even systemic changes, like greater oversight of officers\u2019 use of force, can be slow to yield results. \u201cThey change the \u2018inputs\u2019 through training, record keeping, community involvement and other internal reforms, but the inputs don\u2019t necessarily translate into changes in \u2018outputs\u2019 including racial disparities, use of force, or other constitutional issues,\u201d wrote Jeff Fagan, a Columbia University law professor, in an email. \u201cThe results have been quite variable. \u201d Consent decrees can span years and many of the Obama administration\u2019s key settlements have just begun, including those in Cleveland and Albuquerque. So it would be premature to assess their success. Some reform advocates have expressed fears that the Trump administration will fail to investigate police departments or enforce consent decrees, robbing them of what they view as a crucial lever to compel change. Even some police chiefs might mourn a retreat from consent decrees. Baltimore\u2019s police commissioner, Kevin Davis, has said that a consent decree would aid community relations. Charles H. Ramsey, who as Washington\u2019s police chief invited the Justice Department to review his department, said, \u201cThe DOJ gives legitimacy to the changes that you\u2019re making. \u201d Chiefs may want consent decrees in order to insulate them from political and union opposition to change, as well as make it easier to demand money to pay for reforms. Mr. Sessions wrote in his critique of consent decrees in 2008 that he is aware of that strategy. \u201cSuch decrees are particularly offensive when certain governmental agencies secretly delight in being sued because they hope a settlement will be reached resulting in the agency receiving more money,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThus, the taxpayers ultimately fund the settlement enacted through this undemocratic process. \u201d",

        "text": "VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. \u2014 A Falcon 9 rocket roared into the sky on Saturday carrying 10 communications satellites \u2014 a return by SpaceX and its billionaire leader, Elon Musk, to the business of launching satellites to orbit. But financial details disclosed this past week about the company overshadowed the successful liftoff, raising questions about the viability of Mr. Musk\u2019s plans for SpaceX and his vision of sending people to Mars. SpaceX, based in Hawthorne, Calif. has been set back since September, when a different Falcon 9 caught fire and exploded on a launchpad in Florida, destroying the rocket and its payload, a $200 million Israeli satellite that Facebook had planned to lease to expand global internet services. The company\u2019s rockets had been grounded since then. An internal investigation concluded that a failure of a helium vessel in the second stage liquid oxygen tank had led to the conflagration. The Federal Aviation Administration, which regulates commercial space launches, accepted SpaceX\u2019s report on the explosion\u2019s causes on Jan. 6 and issued a launch license, clearing the way for Saturday\u2019s liftoff here, on the other side of the country. To prevent a recurrence, SpaceX adjusted its fueling procedures to avoid overcooling of the helium. Saturday\u2019s countdown proceeded smoothly, with the liftoff occurring within a window that would send the rocket on a trajectory to line up with the orbit of a group of current Iridium Communications satellites. The new satellites are more powerful than the original ones, which have been in orbit nearly two decades and have outlived their designed lifetimes. SpaceX also repeated its feat of recovering the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket, landing it on a floating platform named \u201cJust Read the Instructions\u201d in the Pacific. Less than 90 minutes later, mission control received confirmation that all 10 satellites had been successfully deployed. Over the next 14 months, the company plans six additional Falcon 9 launches to deploy 60 more Iridium satellites that will completely replace the constellation. In the the successful launch helps put SpaceX back on track. The explosion and subsequent grounding created a backlog of launches, including cargo missions for NASA to the International Space Station. September\u2019s explosion was SpaceX\u2019s second failure in 15 months a Falcon 9 rocket carrying NASA cargo disintegrated in flight in June 2015. On Friday, The Wall Street Journal reported that SpaceX had lost $260 million in 2015 after the earlier accident, and revenue dropped 6 percent to $945 million. In earlier years, SpaceX officials including Mr. Musk described the company as consistently profitable that claim has been removed from SpaceX\u2019s website. Company officials did not dispute the numbers reported in The Wall Street Journal article, but portrayed a rosy future. \u201cSince 2002, we have been at the forefront of revolutionizing space technology, with a solid track record of success, strong customer relationships and more than 70 future launches on our manifest, representing over $10 billion in contracts,\u201d Bret Johnsen, SpaceX\u2019s chief financial officer, said in a statement. \u201cFurthermore, with over $1 billion in cash reserves and no debt, the company is in a financially strong position and is well positioned for future growth. \u201d SpaceX hopes to launch its larger Falcon Heavy this spring. The Heavy, years behind schedule, would become the world\u2019s most powerful rocket since NASA retired the Saturn 5 more than 40 years ago. SpaceX also plans to refly one of its recovered boosters this spring. By reusing instead of throwing away rocket boosters, SpaceX hopes to significantly reduce the cost of launches. Also on the schedule is an abort test of SpaceX\u2019s Dragon 2 capsule, a crucial safety prerequisite that it must conduct before the company can begin ferrying NASA astronauts to the space station next year. By applying Silicon Valley entrepreneurial practices to aerospace, SpaceX has undercut prices and disrupted the rocket launch business. That brought in many customers like Iridium, which is paying more than $450 million for the seven launches. The bid from one of SpaceX\u2019s competitors was $1. 2 billion, said Matthew J. Desch, Iridium\u2019s chief executive. Without SpaceX\u2019s lower costs, Iridium could not have afforded to replace its group of satellites, Mr. Desch said. \u201cThe Falcon 9 is perfect for what we want to do,\u201d he said. But the lower costs make it difficult to see how SpaceX could earn enough profit to finance its grand ambitions. In September, Mr. Musk unveiled his vision for what he called the Interplanetary Transport System \u2014 a gigantic rocket with 42 engines that could take 100 passengers to Mars as early as 2024. SpaceX has described plans to offer satellite internet services with more than 4, 000 satellites. The forecasts described by The Wall Street Journal, which were produced in early 2016, show how much the company is depending on this new business. SpaceX projected that current rocket launching business would quintuple in revenue, to $5 billion, in 2025. Satellite internet services, still in the early planning stages, were projected to bring in more than $30 billion in revenue and generate the bulk of more than $20 billion in profit for the company. During the September announcement, Mr. Musk spoke of \u201ca huge partnership\u201d to get to Mars, but did not describe what kind of partnership he foresaw. The incoming Trump administration has not outlined in detail its plans for NASA, although some of the \u2019s advisers, including Newt Gingrich, are pushing for a greater reliance on commercial companies like SpaceX. Other Republicans, however, have been strong defenders of the Space Launch System, the big, expensive rocket that NASA is developing for a Mars mission.",

        "text": "MELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 \u201cSo Ivan, are you calling Andy \u2018Sir\u2019?\u201d Ivan Lendl paused and then laughed, which would surely seem strange to those who know him only as Andy Murray\u2019s coach in the front row of the players\u2019 box. \u201cDefinitely not,\u201d Lendl said, chuckling some more before heading off down the crowded main hallway inside Rod Laver Arena at the Australian Open. Clearly, not much has changed in the Murray camp since his remarkable stretch run to the No. 1 ranking and a knighthood in 2016. He is still tough on himself on court and on the changeovers. Still Andy \u2014 not Sir Andy \u2014 to his peers and mentor in chief, Lendl. Still deadpan and droll with his voice that sounds as if it emanates from a mine shaft. Asked on Monday by the interviewer John Fitzgerald how Murray\u2019s wife, Kim, was handling the transition to Lady Kim, Murray said, \u201cNo more swearing during my matches, for anyone who saw that a few years ago. \u201d He was referring to Kim\u2019s courtside language during his semifinal victory over Tomas Berdych at the 2015 Australian Open. Her tirade did not go unnoticed, and she returned for the final cheekily wearing a shirt that read, \u201cParental advisory explicit content. \u201d Presumably, Lady Kim won\u2019t be wearing that sort of thing in the players\u2019 box from here on, either (or at least she wasn\u2019t on Monday). \u201cI haven\u2019t found it distracting really,\u201d Murray said of the knighthood. \u201cI mean, I found out about it four or five weeks ago. Maybe if it happened a day or so, two days before the tournament. But I\u2019ve had enough time to get my head around it. \u201d Just as he has had plenty of time to prepare himself for the role of No. 1, however long it lasts. I asked him on Monday, after his stuttering (5) victory over Illya Marchenko, if there had been any downside to No. 1, thinking he might bring up extra demands or burdens. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been great. I think because it\u2019s taken me so long to get there, obviously I want to try to stay there. But also I feel like I\u2019m mature enough now to handle it. Maybe if it happens when you\u2019re very young, you might feel extra pressures. The responsibilities might feel a bit much, but I think because I\u2019m much older and more mature, it\u2019s been good. \u201d The conventional tennis wisdom is that it is harder to hang on at the top than to reach the top. \u201cI hope not,\u201d Murray said. But for anyone who believes that he now has nowhere to go but down, that is hardly true in Australia. He has reached five singles finals in Melbourne and lost all five. No man has done so well at any Grand Slam tournament without breaking through to win the title. Others have lost five finals in the same major event, including Lendl, who lost five at the United States Open. But he also won three. Bill Johnston lost six finals at the United States Championships, but won the event twice. John Bromwich lost five finals at the Australian Championships in the era, but won the title twice, too. Murray, at 29, is in unfortunately uncharted territory, all the more so because Novak Djokovic ended his own long run of frustration at the French Open last year by finally taking the title after reaching four semifinals and three finals. \u201cLook, it\u2019s still a remarkable record, five Slam finals in Australia, and deep down I think it means an enormous amount to Andy to finally complete the puzzle,\u201d said Roger Rasheed, the Australian who once coached Lleyton Hewitt when Hewitt was chasing the title here without success. But Hewitt reached only one final in Melbourne. Murray is here and has a better winning percentage at the Australian Open than at any other Grand Slam tournament except Wimbledon. \u201cAndy\u2019s been so close,\u201d Rasheed said. \u201cWhat more does he have to do? Well, it\u2019s not a matter of big changes. It\u2019s just been a matter of points and the moments. \u201d It\u2019s a matter of the opposition, too. The first of Murray\u2019s Australian Open defeats in the final came against Roger Federer in 2010. The last four came against Djokovic in 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2016. \u201cAndy played Roger in his prime and has been playing Novak in his prime,\u201d Rasheed said. \u201cIt\u2019s a handful of points changing the way the match falls. Andy\u2019s showing he\u2019s in his prime now. He just needs to get there and roll the dice again. \u201d Murray\u2019s timing may still not be quite right. He played a great deal of tennis down the stretch in 2016 and was beaten by Djokovic in a final in Doha, Qatar, to start this season. Freshness just might be a factor down the stretch as well as Djokovic\u2019s eagerness to restore the pecking order. But it does not seem quite right in light of their abilities that Djokovic has six Australian Open titles and Murray has not even one. He broke down in tears after losing to Federer in 2010. He stared vacantly into space after losses to Djokovic and sportingly came up with the right words amid major disappointment. And yet he insisted on Monday that his emotions were not mixed when he thought about this tournament. \u201cHonestly, they\u2019re totally positive,\u201d said Murray, who plays Andrey Rublev in the second round on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of tough losses here, for sure. But I love it here. Played some great matches as well, but just haven\u2019t managed to win the final. But, you know, I keep coming back to try. I\u2019ll keep doing that until I\u2019m done, but I still feel like I\u2019ve got a few years left to try and do it. \u201d He is, by any measure, due for a change of fortune in Melbourne. And if you like your sports with foreshadowing, the only other top tennis player to receive a knighthood was Sir Norman Brookes, the Australian star of the early 20th century. Guess whose name has been given to the trophy awarded to the men\u2019s champion at the Australian Open?",

        "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 In the Virginia suburb of McLean, where the local diner is a C. I. A. breakfast hangout, Gen. Michael V. Hayden, who ran the agency for George W. Bush, is playing career counselor these days. With Donald J. Trump attacking the intelligence community, the general says his \u201cold tribe\u2019\u2019 is feeling \u201ca special angst. \u201d In Takoma Park, Md. a \u201c zone\u201d since 1983, a resistance movement is taking shape. Nadine Bloch, an activist and artist, is running training on nonviolent protest \u2014 complete with mock police officers wielding rolled up newspapers as batons. And here in the District of Columbia, where 91 percent of voters cast their ballots for Hillary Clinton, \u201c panic\u201d is setting in, said John Feehery, a Republican strategist and Trump enthusiast. Leslie Harris, a liberal Democratic lawyer, uses war imagery: \u201cI feel like my city is about to be invaded. \u201d Washington has always been a chameleon of a city, accustomed to remaking itself when the White House changes hands. But as Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural draws near, in a nation so deeply divided that it seems the political middle has entirely disappeared, perhaps no place in America feels as unsteady and on edge as the capital, which Mr. Trump calls \u201cthe swamp. \u201d With his 6 a. m. Twitter blasts and style \u2014 and a roster of conservative Cabinet picks eager to do an on President Obama\u2019s policies \u2014 Mr. Trump has upended the city\u2019s rhythms and jangled its nerves. The White House press corps is fighting to keep its work space in the West Wing. lobbyists worry their clients will turn up in his Twitter feed. Civil servants, many of them working class, say he knows nothing about running a bureaucracy. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly what to expect from Trump, except that he\u2019s combative,\u201d said Robert Dallek, a presidential biographer, who has lived here for 20 years. And furthermore, Mr. Dallek complained, \u201cIt\u2019s offensive to be called a swamp. \u201d At their core, Washington and its suburbs are company towns, populated by people who live and breathe policy and politics, or work in the sprawling federal bureaucracy. The region is \u201cone of the largest and wealthiest economies in the world,\u201d the Brookings Institution recently reported \u2014 one reason much of America, which suffered greatly during the recession, resents those in the capital. But like the rest of America, Washington is also a real place, with real people, who have lived here for decades. The permanent occupants of \u201cthe swamp\u201d see presidents come, and see them go. And no matter what their politics, people agree with Mr. Feehery that this transition \u201cfeels different\u201d from any in recent memory. Ms. Harris is an archetypical northwest Washingtonian. A policy wonk, she grew up somewhere else, Atlanta, and got a taste of politics as a student. When Jimmy Carter won the presidency, she was in the unusual position of being 26 and knowing a lot of powerful people here. She attended law school at Georgetown, married a doctor and raised a daughter and a son. Now semiretired, she used to run the Center for Democracy and Technology, which advocates internet freedom. She has often worked with Republicans they are her friends. But when Mr. Trump was elected, suddenly America\u2019s divisions hit home. When Mike Pence, the vice rented a house nearby, his neighbors decorated their homes with gay pride rainbow flags. When a white supremacist group hosted a dinner at a nearby Italian restaurant, Maggiano\u2019s, protests erupted outside. Then Comet Ping Pong, a pizzeria where Ms. Harris takes her grandchildren, was targeted by a fake news story involving Mrs. Clinton. Ms. Harris, savvy about the media, organized community support. Soon after, a gunman turned up at the restaurant and fired shots inside. \u201cIt was beyond my imagination,\u201d she said. Just over the Maryland line, Takoma Park is a \u201csanctuary city,\u201d which refuses to prosecute undocumented immigrants. Mr. Trump does not look kindly on that. Days after the election, Ms. Bloch, 55, the organizer, helped pull together Takoma Park Mobilization, a new group aimed at \u201cstanding up for our neighbors,\u201d she said. More than 500 people attended the first meeting. They have since divided themselves into committees and subcommittees, with titles like \u201cImmigration\u201d and \u201cWomen\u201d and \u201cCivil Rights,\u201d and have been holding weeknight meetings in the firehouse and the airy historical society headquarters, next door to Bikram Yoga and down the street from the food . Next up: sessions aimed at liberal civil servants agonizing about whether to quit their jobs. \u201cIt may be better for us for people to stay,\u201d Ms. Bloch said, \u201cand figure out how to resist within the system. \u201d In northeast Washington, a heavily quadrant of the city, such discussions seemed ludicrous people there don\u2019t plan to protest. They just want to stay out of harm\u2019s way. On a snowy Saturday morning at Perfection Unisex Salon, the stylist Chante Watts, 37, urged some of her clients, who are teachers, to come in for cuts on Inauguration Day. They all intend to stay home. She was running a hot comb through the hair of Chris Vera, who helped explain why. Ms. Vera, 32 and a city employee, has been asked to help with the inaugural she fears violence will erupt that day. \u201cNobody wants to be within a radius,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody\u2019s feeling quite safe. \u201d Yet in the Virginia suburb of Fredericksburg, about an hour\u2019s drive from here and home to many military people and religious conservatives, Tina Whittington, vice president of an group, has noticed a pickup in home building. \u201cI think there is huge anticipation that this transition is going to be good for our community,\u201d she said, though she confessed that even there, in the heart of Trump country, the feeling is \u201cstill a little apprehensive, wait and see. \u201d In transitions past, Washington has filled with talk of Georgetown parties and the first lady\u2019s ball gown, and how the city\u2019s culture might change. When President Carter left, the capital traded a Georgia peanut farmer and nuclear engineer for an actor turned politician from California, Ronald Reagan. Bill Clinton brought a touch of Arkansas. George W. Bush ushered in Texas swagger and cowboy boots, and made McLean, where General Hayden lives, the hot neighborhood for that era\u2019s Republican elite. The Obamas honored Stevie Wonder at the White House, and brought in art and culture. They made the city, where blacks now account for 49 percent of the population \u2014 down from 60 percent in 2000, a decline that reflects gentrification \u2014 their own. In black neighborhoods, Michelle Obama will be missed, perhaps more than her husband. (They are not going far. They have rented a lavish home in Kalorama, an exclusive section of the city where Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, will also live.) But with his wife, Melania, and son Barron keeping their primary residence at Trump Tower at least until the school year is out, Mr. Trump may not be spending much time here. That is fine with Mark Salter, a former aide to Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who is Mr. Trump\u2019s nemesis on Capitol Hill. \u201cThe less he\u2019s here the better, as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d Mr. Salter said. Movement conservatives, though, are ecstatic. After eight years in the policy wilderness, scholars at the Heritage Foundation, a policy organization, are helping guide the new Trump administration on ideas and personnel. \u201cFolks were pretty happy,\u201d said Wesley Denton, the Heritage spokesman, when Mr. Trump gave them a during his recent news conference. But in Democratic policy circles there is little lightness this time around. Neera Tanden, a former adviser and strong ally of Mrs. Clinton, has little patience for questions about the city\u2019s mood. She now leads the Center for American Progress, a leading progressive think tank, a job that makes her a de facto leader of the Democratic resistance. \u201cHe\u2019s going to deport undocumented people,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cHow Washington responds is low on the totem pole of problems with this administration. \u201d The unease runs especially deep among those General Hayden calls \u201cRepublican internationalists,\u201d who advocate engagement with other nations but possess a hawkish suspicion of Russian and Chinese intentions. Having described Mr. Trump as Russia\u2019s \u201cuseful fool\u201d on the opinion page of The Washington Post, the general, 71, would never be offered a job. But with Mr. Trump openly questioning the \u201chigh confidence judgment\u201d by the C. I. A. about Russian hacking, he has been entertaining a steady stream of visitors wary of joining the new administration. \u201cI say, \u2018Yeah, by all means, if the asks you to serve, consider it seriously,\u2019 \u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cBut don\u2019t think of it as a lifetime commitment you remain a free agent. \u2019\u2019 If there is a historical parallel to this moment, it may be to President Reagan, said Kenneth M. Duberstein, a former Reagan chief of staff. He recalled how liberal Reagan critics sniffed, \u201cHow do you trust this actor with his finger on the nuclear trigger?\u201d conveniently forgetting he had been a governor of California. (Mr. Trump, by contrast, has never held public office.) And if the denizens of the swamp appear to be in some kind of defensive crouch, Mr. Duberstein says, there is perhaps good reason for that: \u201cDonald is saying there\u2019s a new sheriff in town. \u201d",

        "text": "KINSTON, N. C. \u2014 Just before Christmas, in the soup kitchen that serves this small town built on tobacco, textiles and hogs, the chef and cooking show star Vivian Howard finished stirring a pot of pork and sweet potato stew and turned to a local television reporter. How does it feel, the reporter asked, to know that she had saved her hometown? \u201cIf I had saved Kinston,\u201c she replied, \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t need a food bank, and all these people wouldn\u2019t be waiting for lunch. \u201d Ms. Howard, 38, has been called many things. Her mother calls her the life of the party. Her father calls her Big Time, a nickname from her childhood. A few of the 80 people she employs call her a control freak. But \u201chometown hero\u201d may be the label that makes her most uncomfortable. \u201cSaving a town was not what I was trying to do,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just a storyteller. A storyteller who cooks. \u201d Still, Ms. Howard, the girl who spent her childhood plotting an escape from this rural eastern North Carolina county, has become an unlikely engine in its economic and cultural revival. Twelve years ago, when her family talked her into coming home to open a restaurant, she thought that somehow she had failed. Now, Ms. Howard is five seasons into \u201cA Chef\u2019s Life,\u201d her popular public television show. Her restaurant, Chef the Farmer, attracts talent from the best professional kitchens in the South traveling food celebrities drop by to learn about the region. New restaurants, galleries and a brewery have come to town. The lady who taught her how to make biscuits can charge tourists $100 for a private lesson. At first glance, the show seems an unlikely hit: a about running a restaurant, managing a family and how best to cook regional specialties like cabbage collards or flounder caught from the nearby Atlantic, or seasoning meat coaxed from the jowls and tails of pigs. Guests include the guy at the fish store, the neighbors who make collard kraut, and the farmer who sells the restaurant its vegetables. But to many of the show\u2019s three million fans, and to the guests who travel hundreds of miles to eat at her restaurant, Ms. Howard is a rural Princess Leia. In the wake of an election that laid bare the nation\u2019s political, cultural and economic divisions, her life has a particular resonance with the kind of people who see her story as theirs. \u201cWhat I came to realize was that much of rural America feels forgotten and misunderstood and, frankly, hopeless,\u201d Ms. Howard said. \u201cUrban folks are afraid of rural folks, and rural folks are afraid of urban folks. On our show, we try to bridge the gap. \u201d She and her team paid for the first season, which aired in 2013, with a crowdsourcing campaign and a little money from organizations like the North Carolina Pork Council, Blue Cross Blue Shield and a group of civic leaders. The show was something of a Hail Mary pass for a region trying to find something to replace tobacco production and factory work. \u201cI like to call it more like \u2018Waiting for Guffman,\u2019\u201d said Ben Knight, 40, Ms. Howard\u2019s husband and the restaurant\u2019s manager, who enjoys his own celebrity status among fans. The show caught on, winning a Peabody Award and a daytime Emmy. Sponsorship is so robust that they can afford to pay some of the local residents who appear as guests. On about any weekend night, most of the 220 diners who land a seat at her restaurant will be from somewhere else. Her parents, John and Scarlett, are regulars. After they eat, they\u2019ll take a spin through the parking to count the license plates. \u201cIt\u2019s the darn craziest thing I have ever seen,\u201d John Howard said. \u201cPeople will drive 300 miles for a meal. \u201d (As one of the state\u2019s largest commodity hog producers, he also can\u2019t believe the price his daughter pays for local, pork.) On a recent night, Sarah Reichard, 35, arrived for dinner with her husband, Mitch MacDougall, 34. The vacationing Maryland couple had brought a copy of Ms. Howard\u2019s new book, \u201cDeep Run Roots,\u201d neatly annotated, with sticky notes marking their favorite recipes. At 564 pages, the book is both an important catalog of the unique cooking style of coastal North Carolina and a record of the emotional journey of a young woman who grew up feeling disenfranchised and ashamed of her people. Ms. Reichard, who was raised in a small Pennsylvania town, trembled as she spoke with Ms. Howard. \u201cShe talks about things I feel all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cI hate where I\u2019m from, too. \u201d From as early as she can remember, Ms. Howard had wanted to get out of Deep Run, the slip of a community near Kinston where she was born. She was in boarding school by 14, then headed to North Carolina State, where she dreamed of becoming a journalist. She moved to New York, burned out at an advertising agency, and stumbled into a waitressing job at Voyage, a globally influenced restaurant in the West Village. There, she fell in love with a Mr. Knight, 40, an artist who paints large abstract works with glossy acrylics. She attended the Institute of Culinary Education, interned at Wylie Dufresne\u2019s and cooked on the line at Vongerichten\u2019s Spice Market. The couple were selling soup from their Harlem apartment when her asked them to come home to Kinston and open a restaurant in the building he had bought in the faded downtown district. They moved in 2005, happy to be out of New York, living and in a little house on the river that her father calls his nap shack, and finding their way in the community. Still, the economic reality was grim. Hurricane Floyd had ravaged the region six years earlier. The tobacco warehouses and shirt factories had long been shut down, and the DuPont polyester plant was a shadow of its former self. \u201cEveryone here had an excuse for why they hadn\u2019t left yet,\u201d Ms. Howard said. \u201cI was like, \u2018I should be ashamed of this place, too. \u2019\u201d In what seemed to many a foolish move, they opened Chef the Farmer. At first, they served fancy city food. She remembers the day her sister pointed out that three of the four desserts had vegetables in them, and that didn\u2019t mean carrot cake. \u201cI was cooking down to people,\u201d Ms. Howard said. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like these people had anything to teach me. \u201d She decided to embrace the local dishes she had grown up eating. She could elevate the wild muscadine grapes, the butter beans and the \u201ctom thumbs\u201d \u2014 pork sausages whose casings are made from pig appendixes. In the process, she elevated herself. She came to consider the people in her town as guides to a stronger, simpler way of living. Buoyed by the increased interest in Southern cooking and a few good mentions in the regional press, she persuaded the documentary filmmaker Cynthia Hill to make a TV show. Ms. Hill had grown up seven miles away from Ms. Howard, and she understood the desire to leave a place and then come home again. \u201cInitially, I think she was just trying to save herself,\u201d Ms. Hill said. \u201cIn the process, she is saving a lot of people. \u201d The show has started a sort of renaissance in the town, where a local investor has opened a boutique hotel and the Mother Earth brewing company and taproom. Storefronts are being refurbished. The couple has opened an oyster bar and burger joint called the Boiler Room across the alley, and are planning a bakery. \u201cI don\u2019t think she realized this was all going to happen, but right now she\u2019s the hometown girl that made good and came back, which gives her some cachet,\u201d said Bill Smith, a chef and Southern food authority who grew up in the area. Mr. Smith appeared on a recent holiday special, helping Ms. Howard and her neighbors kill a pig and make corned ham from it. Not everyone, however, is entirely enamored of the food. Grayson Haver Currin, until recently a longtime editor at Indy Week, an alternative paper published in the Hill triangle, thinks chefs like Sean Brock in Charleston, S. C. and Ashley Christensen in Raleigh do a better job interpreting the traditional Southern culinary canon for modern eaters. \u201cThat said, in Kinston it\u2019s kind of that food like that exists,\u201d Mr. Currin said. \u201cThe story of that family and what they\u2019ve accomplished in postindustrial America is fascinating. But it\u2019s a slow process and it\u2019s a limited process. No matter how many $ restaurants you put in that town, you can\u2019t change the economics and racial realities. \u201d The average annual income in Lenoir County, which has about 58, 000 people, is $20, 191. In Kinston, the county\u2019s most populous community, almost 70 percent of the residents are black, while most of its elected leadership is white. At the fish store and the Piggly Wiggly, black customers didn\u2019t seem to know about Ms. Howard\u2019s show or her restaurant. The managers, who were white, did. The region\u2019s troubles only got worse in October, when floodwaters brought on by Hurricane Matthew devastated the community. Four died, bridges were washed away, and roads were closed for weeks. Four of the six hotels in the town flooded, and more than 3, 200 people applied for help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Ms. Howard was on her book tour when the hurricane hit Kinston. Her marketing plan was to tour 24 cities in a food truck. For $50, people got a book and a simple supper, like a bowl of eastern North Carolina fish stew and eggs, built from chunks of fish layered with potatoes and onions and flavored with onions, tomato paste and chile flakes. All but one event sold out. Fans lined up to tell Ms. Howard about their mothers who, like hers, suffer from rheumatoid arthritis. Ms. Howard\u2019s young twins are sometimes on the show, which led to a parade of parents eager to discuss their own twins. Chelsie and Jono Brymer, a young couple from Trenton, Mich. drove to Chicago just to see her. They, too, had moved back home, to a struggling former steel town, to open a little French cafe called Promenade Artisan Foods. \u201cWe watched the show and realized we were not the only ones who ask ourselves if we were crazy to do it,\u201d Ms. Brymer said. By the time she returned home, Ms. Howard was exhausted. From the road, she had organized a statewide fish stew for flood victims that raised more than $30, 000. She had shaken hands with so many strangers that she felt like a politician. She had seen her twins, Florence and Theodore, maybe four times during the tour. Ms. Howard vowed to stay home more, tending both to the children and to the restaurant in a more balanced way. There would be no more with her face on them, and less energy spent on expanding her line of sauces and rubs. And Ms. Howard is changing the show, now shooting its fifth season. It will still be set in eastern North Carolina, but it will shift the focus to the people in her life who cook food from other cultures. \u201cThere\u2019s only one of me,\u201d she said, \u201cand I have to decide what I want to do. \u201d Recipe: Eastern North Carolina Fish Stew",

        "text": "Judith Katherine Dunning had been waiting anxiously for California to adopt legislation that would make it legal for her to end her life. The cancer in her brain was progressing despite several rounds of treatment. At 68, she spent most of her day asleep and needed an aide to help with basic tasks. More centrally, Ms. Dunning \u2014 who, poignantly, had worked as an oral historian in Berkeley, Calif. \u2014 was losing her ability to speak. Even before the End of Life Option Act became law, in October 2015, she had recorded a video expressing her desire to hasten her death. The video, she hoped, would make her wishes clear, in case there were any doubts later on. \u201cShe felt she had completed all the important tasks of her life,\u201d recalled her physician, Dr. Michael Rabow, director of the symptom management service at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cWhen she could no longer communicate, life was no longer worth living. \u201d In recent months, this option has become available to a growing number of Americans. Last June, legislation took effect in California, the most populous state. In November, Colorado voters approved a ballot measure by nearly a majority. The District of Columbia Council has passed a similar law, and the mayor quietly signed it last month. Aid in dying was already legal in Washington, Vermont, Montana and Oregon. So even if the District of Columbia\u2019s law is blocked, as a prominent Republican representative has threatened to do, the country has arrived at a remarkable moment: Close to 20 percent of Americans live in jurisdictions where adults can legally end their lives if they are terminally ill and meet eligibility requirements. The laws, all based on the Death With Dignity Act Oregon adopted in 1997, allow physicians to write prescriptions for lethal drugs when patients qualify. The somewhat complicated procedure involves two oral requests and a written one, extensive discussions, and approval by two physicians. Patients must have the mental capacity to make medical decisions. While that process took shape in Oregon two decades ago, the cultural and political context surrounding it has changed considerably. The states recently considering the issue differ from earlier adopters, and as opposition from some longtime adversaries has softened, new obstacles have arisen. Historically, aid in dying has generated fierce resistance from the Catholic Church, from certain activists, and from others who cite religious or moral objections. Even the terminology \u2014 aid in dying? assisted suicide? death with dignity? \u2014 creates controversy. But the concept has long drawn broad support in public opinion polls. Polltakers for the General Social Survey, done by NORC at the University of Chicago have asked a representative national sample this question since 1977: \u201cWhen a person has a disease that cannot be cured, do you think doctors should be allowed by law to end the patient\u2019s life by some painless means if the patient and his family request it?\u201d The proportion of Americans responding affirmatively, always a substantial majority, has bounced between 66 and 69 percent for 15 years. But support was not evenly distributed: Such laws initially were enacted in states with predominantly white populations like Oregon, and to date the vast majority of patients who have used them are white. \u201cI hear people talk all the time about this being a rich white person\u2019s issue,\u201d said Donna Smith, legislative manager for the District of Columbia at the group Compassion and Choices, who is . \u201cNow, we have proof on the ground that that is not true. \u201d Indeed, aid in dying has expanded to more diverse locales. whites represent a minority of Californians. Colorado is more than 21 percent Latino. In the District of Columbia, nearly half of whose residents are five of six black council members voted in favor of the legislation. State medical societies, once active foes of initiatives, also have begun shifting their positions, citing deep divisions among their members. The California Medical Association, the Colorado Medical Society and the Medical Society of the District of Columbia all took officially neutral stances as legislators and voters debated, depriving opponents of influential allies. So has the state medical society in Maryland, where legislators plan to reintroduce a bill (the third attempt) this month. The American Medical Association, an opponent since 1993, has asked its Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs to look at the issue and submit a report in June, though without recommending any policy. But even as the idea gains acceptance, passage of a bill or ballot measure does not always make aid in dying broadly available to those who want it. In addition to the safeguards the law requires, its practice can be balky \u2014 at least in the early stages. State provisions allow any individual or institution to decline to provide prescriptions. In California, Catholic health care systems have opted out, predictably, but so have a number of others, including Vitas, the nation\u2019s largest hospice chain. Moreover, California hospitals and hospices can forbid their affiliated physicians to write the necessary prescriptions, even if they are acting privately. Some health systems with hundreds of doctors have done so. (Vermont, Colorado and the District of Columbia allow doctors to make individual decisions.) \u201cThe shortage of participating providers has led to a lot of patient and family frustration,\u201d said Dr. Laura Petrillo, palliative care physician at the San Francisco V. A. Medical Center, in an email. \u201cThey had the expectation that it would be available and happen seamlessly once the law went into effect, and then find themselves needing to do a lot of legwork\u201d to find doctors willing to prescribe lethal drugs and pharmacies to fill prescriptions, she said. Sometimes, when patients have waited until late in their illnesses, they die before they can become eligible for assisted death. Or they become too physically or mentally incapacitated to take the drugs themselves, as legally required, even if they do qualify. In areas where many providers opt out, very sick patients may have to travel long distances to use the law. And costs can also prove a barrier. Some private insurers pay for the necessary doctors\u2019 visits and drugs. In California, most do, said Matt Whitaker, state director of Compassion and Choices, the leading advocacy group. But Congress has long prohibited the use of federal dollars for aid in dying, so Medicare and the Department of Veterans Affairs will not cover it. States like California and Oregon have agreed to cover the costs for Medicaid recipients others do not. Cost mattered less years ago, when a lethal dose of barbiturates ran a couple of hundred dollars. But in 2015, as California legislators introduced their bill, Valeant Pharmaceuticals acquired Seconal, the most commonly used drug. The company, known (and condemned) for a similar strategy with other medications, spiked the price, a move Mr. Whitaker called \u201cethically and morally bankrupt. \u201d Now, patients whose insurers will not cover aid in dying face paying $3, 000 to $4, 000 for the drug. Valeant has denied the suggestion that it was exploiting the new law. As a result, physicians are turning to alternative \u2014 and \u2014 combinations of opioids and sedatives for those who cannot afford the standard medication. Despite such obstacles and disappointments, an emboldened Compassion and Choices, with a staff that has tripled since 2008 and an annual budget that has nearly quadrupled to $16. 9 million \u2014 is eyeing its next targets. Over several years, its leaders think they can help legalize aid in dying in Maryland, Hawaii and New York. Aid in dying, it should be noted, may be a vehemently debated issue, with campaigns that can involve thousands of participants and millions of dollars \u2014 but it ultimately has affected a tiny proportion of people. The number of residents taking advantage of these laws in Oregon and Washington has climbed in the past two years. Still, after nearly 20 years in Oregon and eight in Washington, far fewer than 1 percent of annual deaths involve a lethal prescription. (Of those residents who do receive one, about a third do not use it.) It\u2019s not the way most Americans choose to die, even when they have the legal option. Yet the end of life care most people receive needs substantial improvement. While partisans fight over aid in dying, skeptics like Dr. Rabow note, the complicated and expensive measures that could improve care for the great majority \u2014 overhauled medical education, better staffed and operated nursing homes, increased access to hospice and palliative care \u2014 go largely unaddressed. Still, Ms. Dunning was Dr. Rabow\u2019s longtime patient. When California\u2019s act took effect, she began the process of requesting lethal medication. Her speech had slurred further, but not yet enough to render her unintelligible. Dr. Rabow did not want to see her die, and he is no fan of the movement. But Ms. Dunning had been clear, consistent and determined. He wrote the prescription. \u201cShe was ready to have her life end, and no amount of support or medication or counseling would change the situation,\u201d he said. In September, she invited him to her home, where she planned to swallow the fatal slurry of barbiturates. On the appointed day, Dr. Rabow arrived to find \u201ca house full of people who didn\u2019t want her to end her life, but were there to support her and respect her decision. \u201d Over the course of the day, people said their goodbyes, then withdrew to leave Ms. Dunning with her closest relatives, her hospice nurse and her doctor. Her son mixed her Seconal solution and she swallowed it, no simple task for someone with advanced cancer. She lost consciousness almost immediately and died several hours later. \u201cI wished she could have had a natural life span,\u201d Dr. Rabow said. \u201cAnd I would have made a different choice. But I was honored to be there to watch this very dignified woman live her life the way she wanted to. \u201d",

        "text": "A new Senate bill to repeal Obamacare would leave 32 million more people uninsured by 2026 than under current law, according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis released Wednesday.\nThe Republicans' latest attempt to fulfill their years-long pledge would effectively repeal Obamacare in 2020, giving lawmakers until then to come up with a replacement plan.\nThe ramifications of not replacing the law immediately would be severe. Three-quarters of the nation would live in areas with no insurers participating in the individual market by 2026 -- leaving many without an option if they do not have employer-provided or government health insurance, such as Medicare or Medicaid.\nAlso, premiums would about double by 2026, compared to current law, the CBO found.\nIt's unlikely GOP lawmakers will approve this bill, though these frightening figures will make it even harder for them to proceed down this path. House Republican leaders cast aside an attempt to swiftly and simply repeal Obamacare earlier this year after encountering stiff opposition from fellow lawmakers and others, who said it was critical to come up with a replacement bill at the same time.\nThe idea unexpectedly resurfaced earlier this week after Republicans' effort to repeal and replace Obamacare ran aground in the Senate on Monday night. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would call a vote on a repeal bill modeled on 2015 legislation that was passed by both chambers before being vetoed by then-President Obama.\nThis bill, unveiled Wednesday afternoon, is meant to be a wake-up call for Republican senators, to serve as a reminder that most of them voted for it just two years ago. McConnell is essentially daring Republicans to reverse their vote and support the status quo they've been campaigning against for seven years.\nRelated: Trump to GOP senators: 'Inaction is not an option'\nThe CBO score could also pressure Republicans to consider going back to the negotiating table to find a path forward on their more comprehensive health care bill, which would leave 22 million more Americans uninsured over the next decade. That is what President Trump asked them to do on Wednesday during their lunch at the White House, though earlier in the week he called for lawmakers to repeal the Obamacare now and replace it later.\nThe administration pushed back on the report.\n\"We continue to believe that CBO's methodology is flawed, and this score fails to take into account the president's full plan, which includes a replacement for Obamacare and administrative actions to reduce costs and expand access to quality, affordable care,\" a White House official said.\nHere's what the new bill would do:\n-- Get rid of the individual and employer mandates, two of the least favorite provisions of the law, by reducing the penalty to $0. This provision would be retroactive to 2016.\n-- Effectively end Obamacare in 2020 by eliminating the federal subsidies that help people afford individual coverage.\n-- Eliminate Medicaid expansion starting in 2020.\n-- Repeal taxes on the wealthy, health insurers, medical device makers and others.\n-- Defund Planned Parenthood for one year.\n-- Increase funding for substance abuse and mental health needs by $1.5 billion over two years.\nEnacting the legislation would decrease deficits by $473 billion over the next decade, however this doesn't take into account the cost of a replacement plan.\nRelated: Will Obamacare really fail?\nIn some important ways, however, this bill repeals less of Obamacare than the legislation that passed the House and the version that was under consideration in the Senate until this week. It doesn't touch Obamacare's insurance provisions, including the immensely popular protections for those with pre-existing conditions. That will make it more likely to comply with Senate rules that will allow it to be passed with a simple majority.\nAlso, it would not curtail federal support for the overall Medicaid program as the House and Senate health care bills would have.\nStill, repealing Obamacare without replacing it would throw the individual market into chaos, prompting insurers to start exiting swiftly. Lawmakers wouldn't have a lot of time to come up with a replacement, said Cynthia Cox, associate director at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\nInsurers are mid-negotiation for participating next year. Repeal without a replacement will destabilize the market in 2018. \u2014 Cynthia Cox (@cynthiaccox) July 19, 2017\nSome 17 million fewer people would be insured next year, leaving only an estimated 84% of Americans covered, compared to 90% under current law, the CBO found. Premiums would be roughly 25% higher mainly because many younger and healthier people would drop their coverage since they would no longer be penalized for being uninsured.\nBy 2026, a total of some 59 million people would lack coverage under this bill, compared to 28 million under current law, the agency estimated.\nCNN's Lauren Fox and Dan Merica contributed to this report.",

The opinions in this article belong solely to the author.\n(CNN) In a war of words, like the one in which the USA is currently engaged with North Korea, it is essential to use those words effectively. But President Donald Trump is mangling the US's ability to do so.\nIn such an exchange, each state needs three aspects of its words to do three things.\nTheir substance needs to convey exactly what that state means, their register needs to convey how relaxed or how angry it is, and the rank of their speaker needs to show how much authority they carry.\nNorth Korea is careful on all three points. It expresses itself in uniquely colorful terms, but it usually uses standard phrases with quite precise meanings and deviates from these phrases only to signal a change in its thinking. The same goes for register.\nNear-hysterical opprobrium of the US is routine and changes in the flamboyant language signal shifts in mood. Paradoxically this means that sometimes when North Korea is really angry, its language is almost sober. And it uses a carefully graded system of speakers to indicate how firm its statements are. At the bottom of the scale, remarks by unnamed state media commentators are often just trial balloons. At the top, any remark attributed to Kim Jong Un is scripture, unchangeable and non-negotiable.\nRead More",

The stench of blood and bodies whisking by in either direction on stretchers,\" he recalled. \"Just a mind-boggling sight that you're not expecting and not prepared for.\"\nSunrise was one of the closest hospitals to Las Vegas Village, where 22,000 people had gathered for a country music festival, only to scatter in panic after a gunman perched 32 floors above them began raining automatic gunfire onto the crowd.\nWithin minutes, nearly 500 people were wounded. Soon after that, an impromptu fleet of ambulances, private vehicles, taxis, Ubers and Lyfts began scooping them up from the festival site on the Strip and rushing them to nearby hospitals, where besieged emergency rooms became the front lines in a battle to save lives.\nAbout 200 of the injured went to Sunrise, most of them with gunshot or shrapnel wounds.\n\"It was organized chaos,\" said Seiff, 55, who has worked at Sunrise since 2001 . As chief of neurosurgery, he had seen all the injuries in the past and smelled the \"pungent, metallic\" odor of blood.\nBut nothing like this. Not on this scale.\n\"Everything I saw on Sunday night I've seen before, just not at one time,\" he said.\nInjured people filled the waiting room and hallways. Nurses and doctors frantically scurried to triage patients so the most desperate could be treated first.\nNineteen patients -- all head and spine injuries -- came to Seiff. He and Drs. John Anson, Keith Blum and Gene Khavkin handled 10 head-shot victims and nine spinal injuries. Fifteen of them made it, though one patient will be a quadriplegic, two others paraplegic.\n\"That's a devastating thing to have to tell somebody,\" Seiff said.\nA body lies under a sheet as fire and rescue personnel respond to Sunday's shooting in Las Vegas.\nA bullet had passed through both of one patient's shoulders. She couldn't move her legs. The neurosurgeons quickly had to make room for her spine to swell.\nA woman in her 20s had been shot through the eye. The base of her skull was smashed. Another young woman had a bullet wound to her jaw.\nBriefly, Seiff pondered the women's disfigurement but pushed the thought away.\n\"That wasn't the time to think about those kinds of things,\" he said. \"Emotion wells up, and you realize you could start crying, but you force it back down. It's not the time.\"\nCode red = patient near death\nAcross the city that night, the phones of hundreds of Las Vegas medical professionals began buzzing and dinging. Doctors, nurses and other hospital staff -- some of whom had just left work -- were alerted to a \"mass casualty event.\"\nMost had gotten similar texts before -- after bad car wrecks.\nDr. Scott Scherr, 43, medical director for Sunrise's emergency department, had just climbed into bed to go to sleep when he received some 20 texts and five phone calls in just a few minutes.\nThat was unprecedented, much like what he was about to see.\nHe returned to the hospital to find patients pouring out of ambulances, taxis and private vehicles. Friends dragged listless bodies into the emergency room. Hospital personnel waved badges from their car windows as security guards tried to direct them through the mayhem.\nJUST WATCHED Trauma surgeon: Victims 'kept coming in' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trauma surgeon: Victims 'kept coming in' 02:59\nWithin about 90 minutes, the 45-bed emergency department was at more than quadruple its capacity. The chaos overflowed into the pediatric and post-anesthesia units, as doctors and nurses color-coded patients in the hallways and waiting room.\nRed meant dying. Those patients were sent to trauma bays or operating rooms. Yellow meant life-threatening injuries but the patient had an hour or so to live. They could wait. Green was for walking wounded.\nOne Sunrise doctor who served in Iraq and Afghanistan told Scherr it was like \"something you would see in a war zone.\"\nNurse practitioners and physician assistants kept reevaluating the patients constantly to make sure yellows didn't become reds. Meanwhile orthopedic doctors were treating gunshot wounds and pediatric doctors were operating on adults.\nOn a normal evening at Sunrise, there are eight people staffing the emergency room. On Sunday night, Scherr said, that swelled to 200.\n\"We deal with blood a lot, but we don't deal with this magnitude of blood loss all at once,\" said Scherr. In a busy week, he said, his emergency room might typically see 6-7 shooting victims.\nWhen he left the hospital after 20 hours treating people, Sunrise had administered 300 units of blood, he said -- almost 20 gallons.\n'There's not a time for me to feel'\nA few miles away, the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada's Level 1 trauma center -- the only one in the state -- had surged from a norm of 12 to 20 staffers to about 200, spokeswoman Danita Cohen said.\nThese hospitals received the most patients after nearly 500 people were wounded in Sunday's mass shooting.\nMore than 100 patients came through its doors. Dr. John Fildes, the hospital's medical director, told CNN it was the largest wave of mass casualties they had ever seen.\n\"The alarming thing was watching the front door open, and it never stopped. And gurneys just kept coming in,\" he said. \"Trucks would pull up, people would be brought in by friends.\"\nLike so many doctors, Dr. Paul Chestovich, 39, a trauma surgeon whose specialty is major bleeding, was at home when he got the alert.\nHis anxiety soared as he raced to the hospital, and his adrenaline spiked when he saw the bodies and blood.\n\"You take that nervousness and you translate it into energy of action,\" he said.\nDr. Paul Chestovich: \"I had to decide what's going to kill people first and fix that.\"\nComplicating matters was that the trauma resuscitation unit already had nine patients, including a burn victim and a pedestrian who'd been hit by a car, said clinical nurse supervisor Brad Skilling.\nThe unit was two-thirds full, and yet 39 critically injured patients were about to be wheeled in.\nBecause the shooter had used high-velocity rounds, Chestovich's skill set was in demand. These types of bullets, he said, carry an enormous amount of energy, which is \"transmitted to whatever stops the projectile,\" he said.\nChestovich focused on stopping bleeding, along with the \"ABCDE\" of trauma care: airway, breathing, circulation, disability and exposure.\n\"I had to decide what's going to kill people first and fix that,\" the surgeon said.\nSkilling and his counterpart, Toni Mullan, were also called in to help with the response. Mullan had just finished a 12-hour shift and was in the bath when she got the call.\nShe had to stave off her emotions upon seeing the carnage.\n\"To say 'chaos' isn't telling you how the scene was,\" she said. \"There's not a time for me to feel. ... You need to figure out what was going to work.\"\nNurse supervisors Toni Mullan & Brad Skilling were air traffic controllers after #LasVegasShooting.

McLaughlin (@EliottCNN) October 6, 2017\nTriage began outside, between the police barricades and the ER's front door, as a nurse and a doctor directed patients -- limping, in wheelchairs, on gurneys -- to treatment. Skilling and Mullan orchestrated blood, blankets, medicine, CT scans, nurses, lab techs, respiratory therapists -- you name it -- to make sure patients received what they needed.\n\"My job is to figure out how to calm the storm and how to direct it,\" said Skilling, who has worked in trauma since 1993.\n\"I did look around. I took a deep breath. I guess I've been doing it so long I don't get real fazed by it. Back in the day, I did.\"\nFive victims in one pickup truck\nIf a dozen Las Vegas area hospitals -- Sunrise and UMC chief among them -- hadn't been ready to treat the hundreds of injured, it's possible that far more than 58 people could have died.\nBut those doctors and physicians aren't the only heroes. Civilians played a crucial role in ferrying the injured to help.\nAccording to witnesses, while some frightened concertgoers refused to stop as they escaped the scene in vehicles, others lined up along the shoulder to take victims to hospitals.\nLindsay Padgett, 29, and fianc\u00e9e Mark Jay, 37, were among the lucky people to make it out unharmed.\nThey were exiting a parking lot, gaping as shell-shocked pedestrians meandered through the crowd and people ran by with bodies in wheelbarrows and on police barricades repurposed as gurneys.\nA man ran up to their passenger-side window and said, \"Right now, we need your truck. We just need to get people over to the hospital, OK?\"\nLindsay Padgett and fianc\u00e9e Mark Jay drove five victims to the hospital.\nThey piled five victims -- one of them a young man with a faint heartbeat, his limp body slumped over another man's shoulder -- into Padgett's white pickup, along with seven of their friends.\n\"That is just something that you do,\" Padgett said. \"You take people to the hospital. You put them in the car.\"\nThey were able to get three of the victims to paramedics. They took a fourth, a Canadian woman who had been shot in the leg, to Valley Hospital Medical Center. The young man with the faint heartbeat didn't make it.\nIn a Facebook Live video she shot outside the hospital, Padgett said, \"We've got to go back and get more people. Some guy just died in the back of my truck.\" She exhaled and wiped tears from her eyes.\n'There was a lot of selflessness that night'\nAlso in the crowd that night were Las Vegas paramedic and firefighter Ben Kole, Clark County fireman Jesse Gomez and Henderson fireman Anthony Robone.\nThey're among the many first responders who spent their days off at the music festival. Twelve firefighters were shot at the concert, two while performing CPR, said Las Vegas Firefighters Local 1285 President Eric Littmann.\nWhen the bullets began coming down, Robone, 25, covered his girlfriend and told her everything was fine, even though he was not sure that was true. Then he heard his brother, Nick, say, \"I got hit,\" and saw him spit up blood.\nFireman Anthony Robone's brother was shot in chest in #LasVegasShooting.

It was probably one of the hardest decisions I've ever made, but she knew I had to go,\" he said, adding that his wife ended up taking one of the victims to Spring Valley Hospital.\nGomez also struggled with telling people staying behind with deceased friends and kin that they had to evacuate and leave their loved ones behind.\nJUST WATCHED Man stole truck to drive victims to hospital Replay More Videos ...

I have to help somebody else,'\" he said. \"You don't want to give them false hope, and you want to give those that are serviceable a chance.\"\nHe and his daughter, Rachel, an EMT who had been assigned to the concert, worked in tandem, triaging the injured. Kole estimates that between them they had to deliver that devastating news to a half dozen victims.\nBut they also were able to treat about 50 people, he said.\nRachel Kole is 20 and has been an EMT only since May. Amid all the agony, she also saw plenty of altruism.\nOne victim who'd been shot in the arm told her, \"You can move on. There are other people who need you more.\"\nBen Kole and his daughter Rachel, both EMTs, were at Sunday's concert.\n'I'm emotionally blunted'\nNow, the healers must heal. If their long stares, clasped fingers, quavering voices and exhausted sighs are indications, it could be a long process.\nScherr, the emergency room director, said he broke down after leaving the hospital. He watched news footage of concertgoers fleeing the gunshots and \"I could just imagine the fear of those people,\" he said.\nHe wept again later, but for a different reason: He realized, \"Our team did a fantastic job and we saved a lot of lives.\"\nSeiff, the neurosurgeon, hadn't cried as of Thursday. But he came close when, at his 17-year-old daughter's behest, he wrote his first Facebook post in more than a year to let everyone know he was all right.\n\"Friends'll say I'm emotionally blunted,\" he told CNN. \"I don't know.

        "text": "Washington (CNN) Even as the Trump administration is asking Congress to approve a tough overhaul of the nation's immigration laws, the Department of Homeland Security is also quietly exploring ways it could transform the US immigration system on its own.\nThe department has been examining a range of subtle modifications to immigration policies that could have major consequences, including limiting protections for unaccompanied minors who come to the US illegally, expanding the use of speedy deportation proceedings, and tightening visa programs in ways that could limit legal immigration to the US, according to multiple sources familiar with the plans.\nNone of the policies being explored are finalized, according to the sources, and are in various stages of development. Any of them could change or fall by the wayside. Some of them are also included at least in part in the wish list of immigration priorities that President Donald Trump sent to Congress this week, and it's unclear whether the administration will wait to see the results of negotiations over the future of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that President Donald Trump has chosen to end.\nStill, the proposals under consideration illustrate the extent to which the administration could attempt to dramatically change immigration in the US through unilateral executive action.\n\"Do you think Obama did a lot? That's my answer,\" said one former DHS official when asked how transformative the change could be. \"They could do quite a bit.\"\nDACA itself was an example of how former President Barack Obama, frustrated with congressional inaction, sought to use executive authority to take action on immigration, putting in place the program to protect young undocumented immigrations brought to the US as children from deportation in 2012.\nBut the administration is now exploring rolling back more Obama-era policies, and changing even older systems.\nDHS did not respond to a request for comment about the policies being explored or its process.\nTargeting protections for unaccompanied minors\nOne effort underway is exploring what can be done about unaccompanied children (UACs), a category of undocumented immigrants who are caught illegally crossing the border into the US, are under age 18, and are not accompanied or met by a parent or guardian in the US. Those UACs, by law and legal settlement, are handed over to the Department of Health and Human Services for settling in the US, given protections from expedited removal proceedings and given special opportunities to pursue asylum cases in the US.\nDHS and the Department of Justice have been exploring options to tighten the protections for UACs, including no longer considering them UACs if they're reunited with parents or guardians in the US by HHS or once they turn 18.\nIn a previously unreported memo , obtained by CNN, the general counsel of the Executive Office of Immigration Review, which manages the nation's immigration courts, wrote in a legal opinion that the administration would be able to decide a UAC was no longer eligible for protections -- a sea change in the way the 2008 law granting those protections has been interpreted.\nThe Trump administration has portrayed the UAC protections as a loophole in the law that can be exploited by gangs, though experts have testified before Congress that the minors under the program are more likely to be victimized by gangs in the US due to a lack of a support network than to be gang members. The administration also has sought to crack down on parents who pay smugglers to bring their children into the US illegally, even to escape dangerous situations in Central America.\nThe White House also asked Congress to amend the 2008 law to restrict UAC protections.\nIn previously unreported comments made last month at a security conference in Washington, acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Tom Homan said that ICE is actively looking at the adults HHS places UACs with, and if they are in the US illegally, they will be processed for deportation -- and if a smuggler was paid, they could be prosecuted for human trafficking.\n\"You cannot hide in the shadows, you can't be an illegal alien in the United States, have your undocumented child smuggled at the hands of a criminal organization, and stay in the shadows,\" Homan said. \"We're going to put the parents in proceedings, immigration proceedings, at a minimum. ... Is that cruel? I don't think so. Because if that child is really escaping fear and persecution, he's going to stand in front of an immigration judge to plead his case, his parents should be standing shoulder to shoulder with him. I call that parenting.\"\nDHS is also continuing to weigh its options to expand the use of expedited removal more generally -- a speedier process of deportation that bypasses a lengthy court process in particular cases -- as authorized by Trump's January executive order on immigration.\nLegal immigration tightening\nOther efforts in the works include ways to tighten legal avenues to come to the US.\nTwo policies being looked at are the subject of litigation in the DC Circuit court -- work authorizations for spouses of high-skilled visa holders and an expansion of a program that allows STEM students to stay in the US an extra two years for training.\nBoth policies were challenged in the courts, and now the administration is considering whether to roll them back.\nOn the spousal authorizations, DHS told the court as much in a filing last month, asking for extra time for the DHS review to finish.\nThat filing points to a DHS review of \"all\" of the agency's immigration policies, citing the President's Executive Order to \"buy American and hire American.\"\n\"Executive Order 13,788 is an intervening event necessitating careful, considered review of all of DHS's immigration policies to ensure that the interests of US workers are being protected,\" the attorneys wrote, citing the order's instructions to create new rules, if necessary, \"to protect the interests of United States workers in the administration of our immigration system.\"\nDHS has also moved to tighten asylum claim credibility thresholds, and is exploring asking Congress for more authority to do so. Another target is reportedly cultural exchange visas, which according to The Wall Street Journal are also under scrutiny after the \"hire American\" order.\nFurther unilateral moves wouldn't even require policy changes, immigration attorneys fear. Attorneys who represent immigration clients fear that simply by slowing down the visa process, DHS could substantially decrease the number of immigrants admitted to the United States. US Citizenship and Immigration Services announced this summer it would begin requiring interviews for all green card applicants on employment and refugee grounds, and that it would roll out required interviews for other categories over time, adding a substantial and potentially lengthy hurdle to achieving legal permanent residency.\n\"If the wait time for naturalizations increases by three months, USCIS can naturalize 25% fewer people per year, which would mean millions of people over a four-year period,\" said Leon Fresco, an immigration attorney and former Obama administration DOJ official. \"Even without a policy change, the administration (can accomplish) dramatic reductions to legal immigration through increases in processing times and taking a hawkish approach to finding reasons for denials of immigration applications.\"\nDHS pointed CNN to statistics showing no increase in the rate of denials of immigration applications, though the backlog of pending applications has grown steadily over the past two years.\nInternal jockeying\nSources familiar with the inner workings of DHS describe an environment where political appointees and policy staff with strongly held opinions circulate ideas that sometimes reach the press before front office and secretarial staff are even aware of the discussions.\nWhile political appointees and career officials are not described as butting heads, some of policy ideas do end up moderated by career employees on practical grounds. One source also described some employees of USCIS, which administers DACA, as getting emotional when the plan was made to end the program.\n\"Once it gets to a senior level, there are pretty robust discussions,\" another source familiar said. \"And once it gets to that level there are folks with ideas, and then folks who have been around for a while who say, 'That won't work.'\"\nThose competing ideas are then ultimately decided on by the secretary and high-level decision makers, though sources say political appointees are sometimes in a position to have influence over what information flows to the front office and top officials.\n\"The secretary and the decision makers end up with that (dynamic),\" the source said.",

        "text": "Written by Andrea Lo, CNN Heidi Pullyard, CNN\nBuilding a resort in the middle of a forest is nothing new. But few can boast as many credentials in sustainability as this retreat in South America.\nLocated 950 meters above sea level in the Choc\u00f3-Andean forest of Ecuador -- a three-hour drive from the capital of Quito -- Mashpi Lodge is designed to blend seamlessly into one of the most biodiverse spots on the planet.\nAt the 3,000-acre (1,200-hectare) reserve alone guests can watch the club-winged manakin bird conduct its courtship dance, trek to 190-feet-tall waterfalls, climb an observation canopy into the treetops, or spot the Mashpi torrenteer frog species, discovered by a team of hotel scientists.\n\"The idea is that you have a symbiosis with all that nature and you become part of the nature,\" Alfredo Ribadeneira, lead architect behind Mashpi Lodge, tells CNN.\n1 / 9 \u2013 Mashpi Lodge, Ecuador Mashpi Lodge is nestled in the midst of Choc\u00f3-Andean forest -- a three-hour drive from the capital of Quito. Credit: Jorge Vinueza G.\nAt one with nature\nThe man behind Mashpi Lodge is Ecuadorian entrepreneur, environmentalist, and former mayor of Quito, Roque Sevilla.\nThe idea was to make a bubble of comfort in the middle of the jungle. Alfredo Ribadeneira, lead architect\nA timber company had previously owned the site, which Sevilla purchased 11 years ago, to save the forest and its inhabitants. Two years of building work and $10 million later, the resort opened in 2012.\n\"I think Mashpi Lodge is a very special case when it comes to the numerous eco-resorts around the world,\" Sevilla tells CNN.\n\"(Protection of the area) is an ongoing effort and we're still working on purchasing more land so we can guarantee 100% protection from logging, agriculture and mining.\"\nMashpi Lodge as seen from an observation tower built for guests.\n\"The idea was to make a bubble of comfort in the middle of the jungle,\" explains Ribadeneira. \"The real luxury is the possibility of being part of this web of life as a spectator.\"\nOn top of the network of logging roads that once covered the site the architects laid a grid of metal mesh tubes \"encrusted in the land\" to serve as the foundation of the property.\n\"The time it took to make all the foundations was very long,\" Ribadeneira says. \"In another place, you would just go and dig a hole and put down foundations -- and that's it.\"\nBut Ribadeneira and his team took great care to avoid disturbing the forest, where possible.\nFor example, the timber firm left behind a platform where lumber machinery had been stored. Ribadeneira decided to locate the hotel there: not only did it have expansive views, but it also didn't require trees to be cut down since the site's vegetation had already been removed.\n\"If you walk around you're not going to see building debris,\" Marc Berry, the hotel's general manager, tells CNN. \"We're very respectful of the forest.\"\nLost in the jungle\nVertical lines have been used throughout Mashpi Lodge to mirror the forest.\n\"We tried to make all the vertical elements of the structure very slender and tall, aiming for a similar proportion to the trees nearby,\" Ribadeneira explains.\nMashpi Lodge's vertical structural elements are designed to evoke a feeling of being \"lost\" inside the jungle for its guests. Credit: Mashpi Lodge\nAnother way of bringing the forest inside was the extensive use of glass -- there are floor-to-ceiling windows in the guest rooms, for example.\n\"The glass reflects the jungle; the glass makes you see from the windows. This generates a magnificent relationship with the exterior,\" Ribadeneira adds.\nOne moment you are at ground level ... and the next moment you are practically inside the canopy of the jungle. Alfredo Ribadeneira\nFurthermore, the hotel was built across three floors to provide a layered view of the forest.\nThe ground level, where the entrance and communal areas are, offers views of two lateral mountain ranges.\nMost of the guest rooms take up the two floors above, looking out into the higher reaches of the forest.\n\"One moment you ... are at ground level with bases of the trees very close to you -- and the next moment you are practically inside the canopy of the jungle.\nViews of the rainforest are visible at every turn from inside Mashpi Lodge.\n\"The sensation that this generates is very interesting,\" Ribadeneira says.\nIn more practical sustainability terms, Mashpi Lodge has been running on hydro-electricity over the past year.\nMeanwhile, 75% of the property operates energy efficient LED lights. The lodge sources its water from local rivers and treats it in a natural water plant on site, while used beverage crates are recycled to cover slippery paths.\nLocal villagers grow organic produce -- fruits and the heart of palm vegetable -- for the hotel's kitchen, reducing the property's carbon footprint.\nIf you build it, they will come\nRibadeneira admits that the building process was challenging.\n\"Initially, when the hotel was not yet inhabited, the reflection of the jungle in the windows made the birds crash against the glass,\" he says.\nThe team leveled the windows in different angles so the birds wouldn't hit them.\nThe Cloud Forest surrounding Mashpi Lodge is teeming with wildlife. Credit: Lucas Bustamante/tropicalherping.com\nTransporting materials to the site and constructing the building was also difficult.\n\"Normally, you would work with materials that are nearby. In this case, the place is so complex that it's very hard thinking about getting the materials there.\"\nI think people miss out this bit (in Ecuador) so this would be a lovely way to come and see it. Michael Bloy, Mashpi Lodge guest\nTo avoid disturbing the wildlife, the architects used small cars and lots of manpower, rather than trucks. Each sheet of glass was carried in. Parts of the property were built off-site and reassembled once they arrived.\n\"You have to be very, very silent and you cannot go and have huge trucks and all those things,\" he explains, or else the wildlife the property wanted to showcase would have fled forever.\nSome parts of Mashpi Lodge were pre-assembled in Quito before taking shape on site. Credit: Mashpi Lodge\nIndeed, an initial downturn in biodiversity proved unavoidable.\n\"The animals went away -- but after a couple of years they were all back again,\" says Ribadeneira. \"That was a very good thing.\"\nWith Mashpi Lodge receiving some 2,200 guests a year, it would seem that their efforts have paid off.\n\"Ecuador has a lot to offer anyway, but this seems a little bit special in terms of how you can approach the cloud forest and how you can see a little bit more of Ecuador,\" guest Michael Bloy tells CNN.\n\"People tend to think of Ecuador as the Galapagos or the rainforest. I think people miss out on here, so this would be a lovely way to come and see it.\"",

        "text": "Washington (CNN) The young blood in the Democratic Party is (still) waiting for its moment.\nDemocratic leaders across both the legislative and executive branches are generally older than leadership on the other side of the aisle, leading to some restlessness among the lower ranks who have been patiently awaiting their turn at the top.\nThe most recent blow to those hoping to climb the ranks? Dianne Feinstein, 84, the oldest senator currently serving in the chamber, just announced a bid for re-election to the seat she's held for two and a half decades.\nThe presidential field also looks like an uphill climb for young Democrats: apart from a couple of standout young senators, names like Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden still loom large among the potential hopefuls.\nPart of the problem for Democrats is one of recruiting. Historic losses over the last decade in statehouses across the country have not helped create a bench of energized new lawmakers. Further Democrats have had difficulty winning new seats in the House since the tea party wave of 2010 and redistricting in the wake of that year's census.\nHaving a generally older slate of leaders could separate Democrats from one of their core constituencies. Younger voters, however, tend to lean more Democratic than older voters. Hillary Clinton won voters under 30 years old by nearly 20 percentage points, while Donald Trump won voters over 65 years old by 7 points, according to exit polls.\nDemocrats (and Republicans) in Congress are getting older\nMembers of both parties in Congress are at their oldest average age in decades, but the average Democrat has about four years on the average Republican on Capitol Hill.\nThe average Democrat was 61.0 years old at the start of this term, the highest average age for Democrats on the Hill in available data stretching back to 1947, compiled thanks to a great piece by 538 , plus recent numbers from the @unitedstates project , an Internet-driven repository featuring data from the Sunlight Foundation, GovTrack.us and the New York Times.\nThe average Republican was 57.2 years old. The gap between the two parties has been roughly four years since the 2010 tea party wave. For two decades before that, Democrats tended to be about one year older than Republicans, on average.\nThe 2020 bench\nCNN asked Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents last month which person they think best reflects the core values of the Democratic Party. The results?\nTop of the list is former President Barack Obama, who can't run for the White House again because of term limits. The average for the next five people \u2014 including Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren \u2014 is 71 years old.\nIt's important to note that the question was not specifically about presidential politics or who should run in 2020. But it does give a picture of who voters see (and don't see) as the figureheads of the Democratic Party.\nOf course, President Donald Trump will be 73 years old on Inauguration Day 2020 and he was the oldest first-term President ever to assume office, when he took the oath in 2017. But the average age of the candidates who ran for the Republican primary field in 2016 is just 60 years old, thanks to fresh faces like Marco Rubio and Scott Walker.\nThe two young names on the list of people who Democrats say share their values are Sens. Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, who each got a nod from 3% of Democrats. Booker is 48; Harris is 52. Then, for good measure, the list rounds out with 77-year-old Nancy Pelosi and 71-year-old Bill Clinton.\nThis CNN poll conducted by SSRS was conducted from Sept. 17-20 among 493 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. The margin of sampling error is \u00b15.4 percentage points.\nLeadership and the old guard\nThe top three Democratic leaders in the House are in their late 70s. Minority leader Nancy Pelosi is 77 years old, Democratic whip Steny Hoyer is 78 and assistant minority leader Jim Clyburn is 77 years old. Pelosi has held the top spot among House Democrats since 2003.\nThe aging among Democratic leaders led to a stunning rebuke from the fifth-highest ranking Democrat in the House, essentially calling on her party's top brass in the chamber to step aside.\n\"I do think we have this real breadth and depth of talent within our caucus, and I do think it's time to pass a torch to a new generation of leaders,\" said Linda Sanchez, the vice chair of the House Democratic caucus. \"I think we have too many great members here that don't always get the opportunities they should. I would like to see that change.\"\n\"There comes a time when you need to pass that torch,\" she said. \"I think it's time.\"\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan is only 47 years old and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy is 52. On the Senate side, Democrat Chuck Schumer is 66 and Republican Mitch McConnell is 75.",

Tree branches are resting on their mattress. Paintings have fallen to the floor. Shattered glass covers the foyer. The floors are caving in.\nThe retired couple of 31 years lives in Ponce, Puerto Rico, a coastal city of 163,000 residents not far where the hurricane made landfall.\nFor Lydia, 78, it's the only place she's ever lived. She was looking forward to spending her golden years on the property where she was raised. Now, she describes her fond memories of growing up here as \"torture.\"\nSurveying the massive damage, Pabon, a stout woman with a stern face, began crying.\n\"I'll take any help, even a little help, but some help,\" she told CNN outside her home, wiping away tears. \"It's really hard ... I won't find another place.\"\nJose Diaz and Lydia Pabon outside their severely damaged home in Ponce, Puerto Rico.\nDiaz, 83, served in the US army during the Korean War. He tried to reassure his distraught spouse that they will eventually be okay.\n\"Things can be repaired,\" he told her.\nAlmost two weeks after Hurricane Maria churned across Puerto Rico, the couple say not one federal official or relief organization has visited their house, which is across the street from a state trooper's office.\nPabon actually had to convince her husband to leave the house before Maria struck. They took refuge in her niece's house and now live next door to their wrecked home, staying with her sister Juanita.\nMany of the 3.4 million US citizens on the island are in the same position.\nOnly about 7% of the island has electricity and 40% has phone service. Even in Puerto Rico's popular tourist areas, service is very checkered.\nDiaz and Pabon survey the damage to their home. \"Things can be repaired,\" he says.\nAccess to fresh running water also is spotty. Southern Puerto Rico has most of its water back, but the capital, San Juan, only has half of its faucets functioning while the island's western area only has 19% running water, according to Puerto Rican government statistics\nLights, cell service and tap water are afterthoughts for Lydia and Jose.

She pointed out that the steel bed frame is still in good shape, despite exposure to the elements.\n\"I would like to rebuild here,\" she said, although her tone does not sound hopeful.\nFor Diaz, it's also almost too much to bear.

        "text": "(CNN) \u2014 Originally designed as a temporary attraction to celebrate the new Millennium, the London Eye has long surpassed its intended five-year shelf life to become the most popular paid-for attraction in the UK.\nStanding 443 feet tall over the River Thames, each 30-minute rotation grants ever-changing, 360-degree views spanning the length and breadth of London (and beyond, if the weather plays ball).\nFirst things first -- it's not a Ferris wheel. It is, in fact, a \"cantilevered observation wheel,\" with 32 fully enclosed capsules moving at a leisurely 0.6 miles an hour. If you're superstitious, don't panic -- it seems the designers were as well, so there's no capsule number 13.\nEach capsule fits up to 25 people, but there's enough space for you to walk around and see how many landmarks you can spot. If you want a bit of privacy (or to join the more than 5000 people who have proposed on the wheel) then you can book a 'Cupid's Capsule' for two at \u00a3380 ($489), Champagne included.\nAvoid the crowds\nIf you can't stretch to that, then bear in mind that the crowds (and lines) are almost inevitable. There are two ways to make life easier\u2014by avoiding peak times, or by paying a little extra.\nThe London Eye is busiest between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. during the UK school holidays, and is quieter at the beginning and end of their opening hours, which vary throughout the year. As a rough guide, summer hours are 10am -- 8.30pm, and winter hours are 11am -- 6pm, but do check in advance on their site. It's worth bearing in mind that it closes for around two weeks every January, for annual maintenance.\nA standard ticket is \u00a326 ($33), if bought in person on the day. Upon arrival, there are three lines\u2014one to buy a ticket, one for fast track boarding and one for standard boarding.\nBuying tickets online will allow you to skip the initial ticket office line and also save you 10%, if you book more than 24 hours in advance. You will, however, be tying yourself into a timeslot, unless you opt for an Any Time Flexi ticket at \u00a329 ($37). All of which would be fine, if the unpredictability of the London climate wasn't an issue\u2014if your visit coincides with fog, or rain, you might not get the same out of it.\nIf you want to avoid waiting as much as possible, your best bet is buying a Fast Track ticket for \u00a336 ($46), which can be bought on the day or online (again, with a 10% discount and the bonus of skipping the ticket office line). It's an extra \u00a310 ($13), but will grant you fast track entry through a dedicated entrance.\nWaterloo station (served by the tube and overland trains) is the closest to the London Eye, at just a five-minute walk away. Both Embankment and Charing Cross are fairly close, at around a ten-minute walk. Westminster station is a short and picturesque walk over the river.\nWestminster station is a short and picturesque walk over the river, where you'll also find the Houses of Parliament, Westminster Abbey and Big Ben. Head in the other direction and you can walk along the river through South Bank, with its skateboarders, secondhand book stalls and food trucks\u2014a Bleecker burger is one of the best in town. If you need to rest your feet, pop into Canteen right by the Royal Festival Hall, for classic British cuisine in a modern setting (their Eton Mess is to die for).\nThe London Eye , Riverside Building, County Hall, Westminster Bridge Road, London SE1 7PB\nBleecker Southbank , Royal Festival Hall, The Queen's Walk, Lambeth, London SE1 8XX, UK, +44 7495 821283",

        "text": "(CNN) US President Donald Trump's attempts to jettison the Iran nuclear deal will, in the eyes of many observers, send a dangerous message to the international community, and to North Korea in particular.\nFor months now, the international community has argued that Iran is fulfiling its obligations under the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action , known as the JCPOA. Trump's campaign promise to withdraw from the accord, however, comes at a time when his administration is already struggling with how to contain the nuclear ambitions of Pyongyang.\n\"Let me underline one thing. In this moment, having a nuclear non-proliferation agreement that is delivering is quite a strategic instrument in the hands of the international community,\" said Federica Mogherini, the European Union foreign policy chief, in September . \"We already have one potential nuclear crisis; we definitely don't need to go into a second one.\"\nTrump said last week that Iran has not \"lived up\" to the spirit of the deal. But experts argue that decertifying the accord will not only jeopardize Washington's ability to influence and dictate global events, it will also make the US an unreliable partner in any future negotiations, particularly with Pyongyang.\n\"Everyone who looks at it says how can you expect to bring North Koreans to the negotiating table if at the same time you demonstrate that agreements that you do negotiate aren't worth the paper they're written on?\" Gerald Feierstein, a former US ambassador to Yemen and principal deputy assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs, told CNN.\nTrump's tweets have criticized the efforts of past White House administrations for \"unsuccessfully dealing with North Korea for 25 years, giving billions of dollars and getting nothing. Policy didn't work!\" But his top diplomat, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, has said that channels with Pyongyang are open and that the US is using them.\nA new Iranian long-range missile is displayed during a military parade in Tehran in September.\nThe signals to the North Koreans are mixed at best, said Adam Broinowski, research fellow at the College of Asia and the Pacific at the Australian National University.\n\"I think that they seem to be perceiving that Trump in particular has no intention of negotiating, no matter what North Korea would do; the White House doesn't consider negotiations as an option,\" Broinowski told CNN. \"As a result you have an incredibly volatile situation.\"\n\"If Trump goes along the same line with Iran, you've got two crises, and the Middle East is already fraught,\" he said. \"What is the point of this kind of brinksmanship that doesn't reinforce your statesmanship in the world?\"\nThen-US Secretary of State John Kerry and Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in New York in April 2016.\nWhere the US goes, the world doesn't necessarily follow\nSeveral major powers have already signaled that the US no longer sets the agenda for rest of the world. When the Trump White House announced in June that it would be withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement, other nations doubled down on the deal.\nTrump said the US was dropping out of the climate accord because of high carbon-emission targets set by the Obama administration when it signed onto the deal two years ago, among other sticking points.\nYet also in June, China and the European Union reiterated their commitment to implementing the Paris agreement and \"as major energy consumers and importers, highlighted the importance of fostering cooperation in their energy policies.\"\nJUST WATCHED Haley on Iran deal: Can't put lipstick on a pig Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Haley on Iran deal: Can't put lipstick on a pig 00:49\nAn American retreat from the world stage would allow other powers, namely China and Russia, to step into the vacuum it leaves behind.\n\"It's a big opportunity for Russia and China to flex their muscles in the Asia Pacific and the Middle East and possibly in Europe, which has a lot of NATO allies worried,\" said Andrew O'Neil, the dean of research at the Griffith Business School in Australia. \"It's a time where you have a lot of neglect of foreign policy and the US taking its eye off the ball. Despite the fact that you've got gifted diplomats and people representing the US, there's only so much they can do.\"\n\"How much confidence can other states, and that includes allies of the United States as well, have in the US to focus its attentions on negotiations for a sustained period of time, commit meaningfully to any deal and to actually implement it at home?\" O'Neil asked. \"There is significant, profound concern about this administration's ability to do any of those things.\"\n(From L to R) EU policy chief Federica Mogherini, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, Head of the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization Ali Akbar Salehi, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond and US Secretary of State John Kerry pose for a group picture at the UN building in Vienna on July 14, 2015.\nIt's expected that the other parties who signed onto the Iran nuclear accord will not renege, even if the US does, said former ambassador Feierstein.\n\"In terms of the Iranian view, if the Europeans remain committed to the JCPOA, if the European business people continue to come and engage in commercial transactions, then probably the interest in Iran will be to remain inside the JCPOA,\" he told CNN.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macros has cited the crisis with North Korea as a \"very good illustration\" of why the agreement with Iran should remain intact. \"We stopped any monitoring, any discussions with them [North Koreans], and what's the result? They will probably get a nuclear weapon. I don't want to replicate that situation with Iran,\" Macron said in an interview with CNN in September\nWhat other options are there?\nAnd just as Trump has not elaborated on the \"one thing\" that would work with North Korea , he hasn't proffered an alternative to the Iran deal should he choose to decertify it.\n\"We need this framework,\" Macron insisted in September. \"If you stop with this agreement, what do you propose, nothing?\"\nThat same month US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley was asked whether the White House's position on Iran would dissuade North Korea from trying to enter into negotiations. Haley said it was more important that \"others know we will stay in a deal as long as it protects the security of the United States.\"\n\"We should at no time be beholden to any agreement and sacrifice the security of the United States and stay in an agreement,\" she told the audience at a think tank event in Washington.\n\"We should always let every country know, whether it's North Korea or Iran or anyone else, that we will always look out for our interest, our security and make sure that it's working for us, not making sure that it's working for everyone else. That's very important.\"\nJUST WATCHED Mogherini: Iran deal must not be dismantled Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Mogherini: Iran deal must not be dismantled 07:55\nMogherini said in September that the 110-page agreement with Iran, which took 12 years to arrive at, was binding and non-negotiable. She said that at a meeting she chaired during the UN General Assembly that month with all the foreign ministers concerned in the accord -- including the US -- everyone agreed that the deal was \"working and is delivering for its purpose, for what's in the agreement, which is a nuclear non-proliferation agreement.\"\nAs speculation churned over Washington's intentions regarding the accord, Mogherini was unequivocal about the EU's position. \"As Europeans, we will make sure that the agreement stays,\" she said.\nA decision by Trump to decertify the deal would send it to Congress for 60 days to decide if it will concur and uphold the President's move. It could choose instead to enact more sanctions, or it could choose to abide by the agreement.\n\"If he chooses to decertify, this Congress will do nothing. They couldn't even repeal and replace the Obamacare act,\" said Joseph Siracusa, professor of human security and international diplomacy at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia.\nBut a decision to decertify would damage America's reputation and its capacity to steer other major geopolitical shifts in its national strategic interests, Siracusa said.\n\"By doing this the US places itself on the sidelines, watching the other powers,\" he said. \"It lessens the ability of the United States not to participate but to lead events. It makes US policy more reactive.\"",

        "text": "Editor's Note \u2014 This article was originally published in December 2015.\n(CNN) \u2014 On a misty morning in Italy , we crunch our way through green-yellow undergrowth as Pepe the dog darts on ahead, nose close to the sandy soil. His tail twitches as he catches the scent.\nLooking first to his owner, he jabs with his paws, earth shooting into the air as he gets closer to the prize.\nI'm in the Tuscan town of San Miniato for the November \"gold rush,\" when the Italian white truffle comes into season. This rare white fungus is as fabled as Moby Dick, and just as elusive.\nThat truffle emotion\n\"The truffle is an emotion. It's not a product, it's not a taste,\" explains my guide Massimo Cucchiara, who's from a family of truffle hunters that reaches back three generations. \"It's an emotion when you find it. It's an emotion when you eat it. I still remember my first truffle like I remember my first kiss.\"\nMassimo's garlicky scented mistress grows underground, close to the roots of oak, hazel, poplar and beech trees, and is only found in a handful of places around the world. It's this rarity that makes it so prized.\nTruffles are one of the world's most expensive foods, and the Italian white is the most valuable of all, with a market price of up to \u20ac4,000 ($4,400) per kilo. Like that heady first embrace, it's impossible to reproduce.\n\"It's nature that decides it,\" he explains. \"We can't cultivate the truffle.\"\nThe San Miniato Hills, with their mild Tuscan climate and soil rich in mineral salts, are the perfect breeding ground for top-quality truffles -- as well as the wine and olive oil for which the region is famous.\nBeware of imposters\nThe rarity and expense of the true white truffle means imposters are rife. Chances are, if you've tasted white truffle you've been eating chemically enhanced tuber borchii -- an inferior Italian truffle similar in appearance but incomparable in taste.\nThe second-rate truffle is sprayed with a harsh artificial aroma that mimics the smell and taste. \"When I go into the restaurant and I get that smell I don't eat the truffle dish,\" says Massimo.\nAs for truffle oil -- most commercial oils are synthetic gloop unworthy of washing Pepe's paws. \"When you eat the pasta with the truffle oil you don't taste it with your mouth, you taste it with your nose.\"\nThe gentle, earthy taste of Italian white truffle is too subtle to be preserved in oil or cheese or meat.\n1 / 15 There are 63 varieties of truffle worldwide, but the most prized is the Italian white truffle, which is in season from October to late December or early January.\nStriking gold\nMassimo's father, Salvatore, kneels down to unearth our first find of the day, brushing at the soil with his fingers with all the care of an archeologist on a dig. It's a 25-gram golden-brown beauty, worth up to $100.\nIts firm texture, umber hue and marbled white-brown interior revealed along a nibbled edge all point to its freshness and ripeness. Then there's the gentle, earthy musk, which builds as it warms in the hand.\nWhen eaten, \"the taste is delicate in your mouth,\" says Massimo. \"The smell though, you could smell for days.\"\nDogs, not pigs\nHunters guess at where the year's harvest might be found by judging the weather, the earth and the plants. But most of all, they rely on their dogs -- rather than the pigs of legend.\n\"It's the dog that teaches you,\" says Massimo. \"Every day you have a new lesson.\"\nPigs might have the sensitive snouts required for the job, but their use is banned in Italy because their overeager rooting damages the truffles' delicate mycelia, the spore-holding web necessary for the fungi's reproduction. Also, it's pretty dangerous to get between a 300-kilogram pig and a truffle it's determined to eat.\nA particular set of skills\nPepe, our dog for today, is a mix of springer spaniel, Segugio Italiano and setter. Like his owners, Pepe is from a long line of hunters.\nHis is a hardy mongrel combination that ensures energy, stamina and a keen sense of smell. While Massimo and I talk, Salvatore and Pepe walk ahead, communicating in a private language built up over nine years of working together.\n\"It's important to know your dog, have empathy,\" explains Massimo. \"You can speak about everything. After a while you speak about your problems!\"\nAncient pilgrim route\nSan Miniato is a quietly beautiful medieval hill town, centered around a tower fortress that commands views over the Arno Valley, with its cypress and olive trees.\nThe forest, wineries, and tiny villages of the San Miniato hills lie to the south, while to the north is busy industry. Santa Croce sull'Arno is the heartland of Italian leather manufacturing. An ideally positioned base for exploring the cities of Florence, Pisa, Siena and Lucca, San Miniato is on the ancient Via Francigena pilgrim route that stretches from Canterbury, England, down to Rome.\nToday's pilgrims come for the annual truffle festival held here during the last three weekends in November, when the normally sleepy town fills with life.\nHonored with statues, lamented with funerals\nThe world's largest truffle was found near San Miniato by Arturo Gallerini and his mongrel dog Parigi.\nHere, truffles are honored with statues. There's a bronze tribute in the town center to the world's largest truffle, a two-kilogram beast found in San Miniato in 1954. Funeral processions are held for them.\nIn 2004, a $52,000 truffle was at the center of a media storm after being bought by a London restaurant. When the truffle spoiled after being incorrectly stored, its remains were brought back to San Miniato for a lavish homecoming lament . A lesson, then, in the importance of knowing how to care for and prepare the truffle.\nContinuing our journey from earth to plate, we visit Italian TV chef Gilberto Rossi at his restaurant Pepenero , for a masterclass.\nHow to prepare the white truffle\n\"We never cook the white truffle,\" explains Gilberto, as he takes white truffle butter out of the fridge, ready to make tagliolini al tartufo.\nThe butter is made by mixing it with leftover truffle shavings and leaving it for a week for the flavor to take hold. Brash oils have no place here. Butter, egg or mascarpone are the only suitors gentle enough to marry with the white truffle.\n\"If you don't know how to use the truffle, you kill the taste in a few minutes,\" adds Massimo.\nSimplicity is key.\nWhile the fresh tagliolini is dropped in boiling water, the eggs and butter are mixed to create a creamy base for the pasta. Gilberto serves the pasta, swirling the strands around the spoon, then shaves about eight grams of San Miniato white truffle on top.\nWe eat it with L'Erede white sparkling wine from local winery Ivana Cupelli. A typical Tuscan Chianti would risk overwhelming the dish.\n\"Sometimes it doesn't work when you mix two diamonds,\" says Massimo. And the taste?\nHail to Gilberto, Massimo and all followers of the one true truffle. As someone only previously acquainted with mid-range truffle oils, it's an awakening.\nRisotto like you wish your grandmother used to make.\nThe next day at the San Miniato Truffle Festival, I eat two dishes prepared by volunteers from the local Truffle Association, served on plastic tableware inside a marquee. They couldn't have tasted better if they'd been served on gold platters by diamante unicorns.\nFirst, carpaccio of Tuscan Chianina beef, seasoned with lemon juice, salt and pepper, and served with valeriana salad, pine nuts and shavings of white truffle and Parmesan. On the side, white bread spread with soft mascarpone cheese and topped with a sliver of truffle.\nAnd then for seconds -- because there always should be seconds -- there's silky, creamy risotto, flavored with broth and seasoned with salt and pepper, and crowned with generous flakes of Tuscan gold.\nTruffle seasons\nWhite truffle season lasts from October to late December or early January. A truffle can be stored, wrapped in paper in the fridge, but only for up to 10 days. So when they're gone, they're gone.\nIn the meantime, there's the Italian black winter truffle, in season from December to March, and the black summer truffle, found from May to September.\n\"We go hunting all year,\" says Massimo.\nThe truffles change, and the dogs change -- Pepe turns his nose up at black truffles, so one of his siblings will step in. But the hunt goes on.\nTruffle in Tuscany tailor make truffle hunting and tasting experiences led by Massimo Cucchiara, from \u20ac65 per person ($71) for two to four people; truffleintuscany.it ; +39 347 903 0371\nChef Gilberto Rossi offers cook-and-eat sessions in his San Miniato restaurant followed by a truffle hunt, from \u20ac180 per person ($198) for groups of eight to 20; Pepenero ; Via IV Novembre, 13 56028, San Miniato; +39 0571 419523\nSerenella Barbieri offers private, three-hour guided tours of the San Miniato Truffle Festival from \u20ac130 per group of up to 30 people ($143); serenella.barbieri@alice.it; +39 347 0740223",

Even as he explains why he is not mourning the narrator describes him as bulging and as having inner violence. no matter what he says it is clear all is not well with him. As hard as he tries there is no way for him to pretend that his son's death does not phase him. When the lady finally asks him, not about the circumstance of the sons death or how he feels abut it, but wether his son is really dead or not, the man can no longer contain his feelings and it all comes out. It seems to me that the way the question is asked, if he is dead or not, forces the man to meet the facts head on and in that situation he can no longer hide from his emotions.",

Inspired by the Garners, Holdings, Hadleys, Kapils, Wasims , most of the young kids want to become fast bowlers. They think that is the kind of bowling that can intimidate the oppasition. The want to give night mares to the batsmen with the pace. But, every now and then, every sport has seen some individuals who set standards, who are born for that particular cause, they are the people who are the best at that particular skill. Shane Warne is one such great player Cricket is gifted with. He revived the dying art of Legspin, he created another version of Spin which is dedlier than the spin bowling. He is the master of flippers, batsmen have no clue what is happening barring some Indian players. The Legerdemine claimed many vicitms ( err ...most as the records state). Records apart, he is one bowler who made the difference at the time of substandard bowlers. Ofcourse, he had his ups and downs in his personal and professional life. But, I havent seen Prasanna much...I regard Warne as the best bowler I have ever seen. He inspires you so much that you feel like learning legspin. However, like other legends, he still have one unconquered land..The Subcontinent and the Indian Batsmen.The East for Alexander The Great, Wimbledon for Lendel, French Open for Sampras .... I salute to this great player. I compare him to the legends like Maradona, Vivian Richards..He is one of that class. Many more victims for this great bowler.",

The following is the translation of the article: [1] \"In the Palestinian Authority, there are 12 security apparatuses, and their number has nothing to do with security but with the fact that there are 12 people who must each be given a security apparatus so they will be important. If there were 40 people with similar characteristics, it would be necessary to please them and establish 40 Palestinian security apparatuses. \"Because there are 12 security apparatuses, each run by a private kingdom, security does not prevail in the PA territories, and it appears that some of the [apparatus] heads are exploiting their apparatuses to gain influence and maybe even to get rich. \"The task of Egyptian intelligence head Omar Suleiman was difficult, because he is interested in consolidating the divided security apparatuses. Lately, Arafat has complied with this demand, but has implemented it in his own way, since he needs to be chairman of every sphere. Arafat has expropriated the right of the prime minister, neglected the role of the Palestinian security minister, and appointed his cronies heads of some of the apparatuses. He has set himself at their head, and transformed his headquarters into the joint operations room of all the security apparatuses. \"Arafat, who lives like a leader with no rival, employs day-to-day tactics with no strategy, and thinks it important to appear in control of everything. This mentality has caused the missing of a rare opportunity, which former prime minister Abu Mazen tried to exploit. Prior to that, other opportunities were missed. -- Just get rid of the damn guy already. The world's oldest terrorist needs to go and fast. He reminds me of that guy in high school that was always hanging around you and your friends, but you really wanted him to just go away because he was either smelly, ugly, not nice, told bad jokes, bad acne, stupid, heavy breather, genocidal maniac bent on Israeli destruction. I am sure you can relate Mr. Arafat considering you meet all these standards. Andrew B.",

At the bus stop we met up with another teacher called Carina (seems that teachers are two a penny over here) and enjoyed (!?) a rather perilous bus journey to the volcano. The views were fantastic but the roads rather windy, almost too windy for such a large bus to manouvere around, we thought, but we made it safe and well to the top. The rest of the journey had to undertaken on foot. It was quite a steep climb! After the first 100 m we were clearly wondering, what the heck are we doing???? However, it was totally worth it. The views of the Amalfi coast were simply fantastic and the volcano itself had an impressive crater which we were able to walk around and take lots of pictures of. We all managed to grab some genuine Vesuvian rock as well which, sorry guys, is my present to you all! That's all I'm bringing back! If it hasn't turned to Vesuvian dust in my back pack by the time I get home. In afternoon we walked around the ruins of ancient Pompei. It was hot and we were tired so we didn't quite see as much as we wanted. It was beautifully preserved but unfortunately we totally missed the house of the fugitives (all the dead people) which was something we both wanted to see. Ah well.... That evening we met with Tennille (from Rome) and Carina and went for nice, civilised meal! Then, an early night as we all had big trips to make the next day. Comment about Pompei: We thought Rome was pretty rough in places, but Pompei....well, it truly is full of perverts ! We were casually walking along Via Plino when some random pulls up in his car and Gem thinks he's about to ask for directions. Bless her - she was quite worried about how she might answer his questions because obviously, our Italian ain't that good. To her surprise, Gem is presented with a rather different question of 'You like...?' and, yes, the man had exposed himself! Oh nice....... Thankfully, we had the presence of mind to simply laugh at him and then walk off. He was undeterred however, as he drove past several more times! (I'm sorry Emma, i was too shocked to use a phrase from the book you gave me!!!) When we swapped this story with other travellers, it turned out that the same man had been doing the same to them too! So be warned, grey punto, dodgy dark haired Italian....avoid at all costs!",

My car wasn't ready until later in the afternoon, so Peja dropped me off, I gave him his paperwork from the Department of Homeland Security, an insurance bill and one of Kelly's CD's. Sabrina came over a little later and we got a mani/pedi. My nails and toes look fantastic. She dropped me off to get my car, and then I went shopping for some shoes. Got a really cute pair of Tiffany blue thongs with a cute flower on em. And a tiny $4 purse. And some toe rings for my new cute feet. (They need all the help they can get.) When I came home, made dinner and tried to watch tv over the roar at Ed's house. He came over and was mad that I didn't stop over for dinner there. Then Peja called. He was just getting out of the shower. I love that at least half of the times I talk to him on the phone, he's naked. I'm not sure what makes him think of me when he's either hot and sweaty and heading in the shower, or naked and toweling off. But it's the best conditioning I could hope for. Association. Seemed like he wanted to perhaps do something, but was tired after 2 hours in the gym. I invited him over.. he said that if he went out he'd call me and perhaps come over to hang with us at Ed's. He didn't though. So I went next door. Heidi and Louise, Karen and (it was their 5th Anniversary--you wouldn't know--they were so bitchy to each other.) and Karen and Chad (ug) and Heidi's manager (double ugg. can't believe I hooked up with her.)After everyone else left, Ed and I got stoned and drank wine.

        "text": "My father recently had a heart attack and, if nothing else, it allowed me to confirm one thing which I had long suspected -- near-death experiences aren't always as life-altering as movies make them seem. It is true that humans are creatures of habit and that old habits die hard. But changing habits doesn't necessarily change who you are or how you approach life. So is sudden enlightenment a myth or just a temporary state of mind that is washed away by the waters of habit?\nI know I've experienced sudden enlightenment. The resulting changes lasted about a year and then I started slipping back into many self-destructive habits. What is it about our culture that leads us to self-destructive behaviour? Why all the junk food, alcohol, drugs, tobacco, caffeine,\npromiscuous sex, and self-destructive social behaviour? Honestly, I think it's due to the faith vaccuum that's been created by science. Science has explained away God and replaced him with a few technical answers and a lot more questions.\nPeople who believe fervently in God are never without purpose because they believe that God has a \"divine plan\". People who truly believe in fate have a similar sense of purpose. So I suppose people who believe in nothing, especially those who vehemently believe in nothing, have no purpose. It is undoubtedly this lack of purpose that causes us to engage in\nself-destructive behaviour.\nIf you have no purpose, you simply distract yourself with your senses. You eat even when you're not hungry just so you can taste. You have sex with no intention just for the pleasure it brings you. You say things you don't mean just to get a reaction. You do drugs because you find no pleasure in reality. There are many self-destructive behaviours we engage in each day.\nWith no moral authority to follow and sense of self-accomplishment, you just kill time until you die.",

Though we would see hin in Reals' team , we would miss him in the next Soccer world cup. He is one of those class players who is very simple and humble. He is not over hyped like a David Beckham, but his greatness was underrated in non-football circles. That trademark header is a joy to watch and the way he can change the game is incredible. We definitely will miss one of the class players in International Football. The Champion Keeps Going Hungarian Grand Prix..and it will be another win for Michael Schumacher. As there is lot of noise going on about Jenson Buttons' move to Williams next season, this grand prix will be very interesting to watch. Though McLaren is looking good, Kimmi has to pray for some luck in this race. Anticipating another Ferrari whitewash...... The weekend would be great with some EPL Football action and the Grand Prix... Ohhh....I forgot completely about the Kick Off of Olympic Games....being an Indian what can I talk about Olympics. Hope our Hockey team tries to Salvage some lost pride. Atleast a Medal for more than one billion people.",

Today is built on tragedies, which no one wants to face. Nightmares to humanity and morally disgraced. Tonight is filled with rage, violence in the air. Children bred with ruthlessness, cause no one at home cares. Tonight I lay my head down, but the pressure never stops. Knowing that my sanity, content when I'm dropped. But tomorrow I see change, a chance to build a new. Build on spirit intent of heart and ideas based on truth. Tomorrow I wake with second wind and strong because of pride.

        "text": "Let's see where was I ? hmmmmm.. I was talking about how I don't like who I had become several years ago because I was consumed with jealousy and insecurities. Anyways, life is good now meaning = a life that sounds boring. No drama = boring. Well, today's post will not be that boring.. Last night I was talking to a friend, V whom I was introduced to by...hmmm, we'll call this female bitch. We used to all be friends but we lost touch with Bitch when she met this abusive guy who would hit her. I'm so glad that V told me about Bitch cuz I don't need those type of females around me. I guess she was very curious to know whether or not me and my boyfriend were fucking. Umm, reminder to her..we're not in high school...half the college is fucking...that is a stupid thing to be curious about. If she was so fuckin' curious as to how me and my boyfriend are...she should have asked. Instead she hung out with a bunch of immature guys who would talk about whether or not we fucked. So these guys would ask her \"Do you think they fuck ?\" and she would tell these guys that she doesn't know because we aren't even affectionate towards eachother and other comments leaning towards the fact that we are not like a normal couple (I guess what she does with her boyfriend is \"normal\" - make out, get touchy feely to the point that they look like they're about to fuck, get beat up & all of this is done in front of whoever is around). Umm, sorry bitch, but I've already finished high school and doing what OTHER people think is cool. I'm not fucking dying of horniness....like her & that fucker who she was talking to....I get some of whatever I want whenever I want. It pissed me off...because I've had to deal with too many stupid females like her. I've had my share of sneaky jealous females and I don't need any more in my life. I guess it kind of hit a soft spot for me cuz my best friend let's her boyfriend say stupid shit like...\"You better give her love otherwise she's gonna find somebody who will\". Ummmm, excuse me but I love my boyfriend and he loves me. We don't have to practically fuck in front of everyone so that they think that we love eachother. Nobody has any idea what I want or don't want except for my boyfriend. I'm assuming it's jealousy that consumes people, so they have to find something that they think is wrong. We don't feel it necessary to show everybody what we do behind closed doors. He also does not hit me, does not call me names, does not ask me \"if I want to suck somebody's dick\" for talking to another guy (Bitch who talks shit about how we don't show eachother affection is in a relationship with a guy that does all of these things to her), and we have been going strong for almost 5 years (on November 22nd). I don't know anybody at my age that has managed to keep a job, go to school, maintain an relationship with their friends, family, and boyfriend. Amongst all things, I'm happy. I've had too many jealous bitches try to act like they have the right to say anything....when in all reality, they just wish they had something like what i've got. Situations like the one with Bitch remind me of this song by Mya called \"How you gonna tell me ?\" Here's one little quote from the song: \"At least if you're gonna try to give advice about my life, have your own shit right Cuz you ain't even livin' what you preach to me So please how are you gonna tell me ?\" I had to express my feelings about that...it bothered me so much cuz I was really nice to this girl and she was busy telling everyone we know how she doesn't know why we are together since we don't even seem to like eachother. Looking at the positive side...At least now I know that when I have a gut instinct about somebody I should listen to it. I used to always tell my boyfriend...there's something about her that makes me not trust her. I just couldn't figure out what it was. I am very naive and can be taken advantage of easily. It has happened to me many times. That's why I've got to learn to stay away from people like her. \"Jealousy is a mother fucker, you weak jealous mother fucker !\" ~Biggie Anyways...now that i have that out of my system I feel much better. Life goes on. I will continue with my great little life...=P",

First, Angelfire has never been friendly to my FTP program (I use the command line FTP that comes with Windows). Second, they've deteriorated to the point where they now insert banners AND pop ups on every page; Fortunecity just has banners. The offset those banners induce on my pages is going to require some finagling and probably the use of stylesheets to get my page to an acceptably presentable state, which means I'm going to have to learn stylesheets.

In had an 83% in the class before the test. I now have a 78%. I have got to pull that grade up. There's no way in hell I'm getting a C in that class. Sometimes I wonder what Life is about. Is life the love of another or a love for the world? Life is a walk in the woods, enjoying the creations of the world, and its natural beauty. Its a rolling mist that passes over a redwood forest in the early morning, one that obscures the man made confusion that causes the sight of what is, always has been, and always will be. Perhaps life is poem written by a love one in the heat of the moment that reveals a peek into the writer's soul. Life is a kiss. A single moment that exists within a split second of time that stretches on into the infinitum that is memory. In the end the beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Fate of a Blossom Some flowers open to soak up light. Some stay closed till late into the midnight. Love is a odd and fickle thing. One moment open, blazing like spring. The next recoiled and shuning the warmth it once desired. Passion without love is an Oxygen deprived fire. Lotus blossoms forgotten in a loss of inhibitions trampled and destroyed in lustful transgressions. Only to be raised from ash but never resurrected.",

Class tomorrow only begins at 2pm, so that's good. We'll wake up at 6:30 and be there by 7:30am. Its gonna be a good exercise as the last time I remebered exercising was.... Anyhow, life has been great as usual. College friends are great, and I've grown closer to a few. Basically, with that, I can get and offer help whenever necessary. Its good to build a network of study partners. Meanwhile, I need to work on my internet addiction. I think I spend close to 20 hours a week surfing the internet and on other net related activities (chat, surf, mail, blog, website management). Hope to cut that down before the exams.",

It was a midnight screening (I know.. it's a bit geeky... but there is a little geek in all of us... or in my case locked in a cage only to be let out on special occasions). Seeing as the geek has clearly escaped, I will continue post haste and get to locking it up again. To start off, I enjoyed it...The movie was pretty good in my opinion. Ebert and Roper said it was the best superhero movie of all time, and I won't go that far, but it was a worthy sequel. I would say as good as the first, which is something few sequels can boast. Needless to say it will be a block buster. While I don't consider what follows to be spoilers since they seem pretty obvious to me, you can feel free to stop reading now. | | | | V A great deal of the movie focuses on Peter Parker who is torn between what he wants, Mary Jane, and what he feels he needs to do, be Spider-Man. That whole \"With great power, comes great responsibility\" speech by his Uncle Ben comes into play of course and Peter has to make a choice again. Its this internal struggle within him that affects him in more ways than one. The only problem I had with that was it took up too much of the movie... More than it needed. After a while you forgot that Spider-Man was fighting Doc Oc and not just his inner demons. But when all that is taken care of the movie picks up a bit. Since it was an action movie the fight scenes were great! Really well done I thought, especially Doc's tentacles. There were a few moments when you could tell that Spidey and Doc Oc were CG... but I can give them a break there. Ok now this is the closest thing in here to a spoiler, (not really though) .... there was one part in particular that dealt with Spider-Man's secret identity that I thought was pretty cool. The secret identity of a Super Hero is always an important part of who he is and with that being said there was just one part of the movie where you ask yourself... did that really happen?? :-) There were also a few cameos by some characters in the first movie that gave the sequel a nice touch. The ending was not bad either...just a little covered in cheese!! The last scene with Mary Jane was a little too overly Hollywood for my tastes. But then the last scene with Harry was much better and darker. It reminded me of the ending of X-Men 2, which left you with a good idea of what to expect for the next one... and makes you eager to see it too!!! This sequel came out only two years after the first, so perhaps we can expect to see the third in 2006. I have heard that everyone is signed on for the third already which is good news... should be one to look forward too.",

        "text": "So last night was the first night in about a month that I've actually fallen asleep and not woken up about every 45 minutes. Granted it was about 2:30 when I finally went to bed, but still, it was good sleep--none of this restless crap I've been dealing with for the last three weeks. So it was looking to be an actual peaceful night's sleep. And it happened to be the same night that we turn back all the clocks, so there was potential for an extra hour of sleep...something I'm in desperate need of. Notice I said \"looking to be.\" 5:45am. Some asshole, who owns one of the buildings across the parking lot, decided that 5:45am on a Sunday morning would be a fine time to start construction on the building. Saws, hammers, crowbars on wood, breaking glass, and construction workers yelling obnoxiously loud at each other. 5:45am! All of this noise? Because they're replacing the windows in the building. Now, great, that's good if you live there. For those of us that don't (and most of the people that do), 5:45am on a Sunday morning is NOT the time you want to be awakened by some jackass construction workers (who don't know that 5:45am on a Sunday in late October is not really the time to show up to work without a shirt on--it was approximately 18 degrees out there at that particular hour of the morning). I was not the only one screaming obscenities at them out my window. I heard it come from at least 8 different people from 3 different buildings. It didn't do any good, but it did prove that these fools were not aware that the clocks switched back today, so they thought it was 6:45am on a Sunday morning. And somehow, that seemed like an okay idea to them?! Here's a little guidance for the dumbasses of the world. Just because you're awake at what you believe to be just a bit before 7am (we'll forget for a second that it was actually just a bit before 6am), does not, under any circumstances, mean that the rest of the goddamned world wants or needs to be up at that particular time of day. Now, I'm used to being up early on days that aren't Sunday, but in no way to I believe anyone else should be or wants to be up that early. Which is why I go about my business before 10am very quietly. I don't make noises that can wait until a reasonable hour (which to me is 9am, but often waits until 10am just to be safe). I don't wash my dishes before then--the pipes make obnoxious noises, the dishes make noises, and I am not genetically able to be in the kitchen without making obnoxious amounts of noise (my mother does this, my grandmother does this, and from what I hear, my great grandmother did it, too). I don't do laundry before noon, because the washing machine is downstairs and will disturb the sleep of the guy who works the late shift and doesn't get home until 4am. Unless I have to, I try not to use the shower before 9am, partially because the pipes are loud and partially because the hot water doesn't regenerate from the early morning working people's use of the hot water until about 9am, and cold showers are not my idea of a good time. I don't vacuum until afternoon because my vacuum is loud, and I get pissed off when people use theirs when I'm trying to sleep. Just a little common courtesy, people! It's SUNDAY! Around here, some old woman is going to come up to you and tell you that you're making baby Jesus cry because you're working on the sabbath. Trust me, they will. It's something I can assure you that my grandmother has already said to 4 farmers she saw in the field on her way to church this morning. It's what they do. They're old and they're Christian. Don't make them angry. They'll lecture you into submission and make you cry in the process. Just put the saws and crowbars and clumsy ass construction workers (who've dropped no fewer than 4 windows and broken them in the past hour) away until it's a decent hour. Or until it's not Sunday anymore! Another subject entirely: Warren Sapp. Shush, man! Dude, everything that happens to you does not have to do with race. People want you to be quiet and not call the commissioner of the NFL a slave-master. Slaves were not paid. Slaves were not richer than 97% of the population. And guess what, just because you're a black man, does not give you the right to call anything negative that happens to you, racially driven. No, it's not racially driven that you got fined for \"accidentally\" bumping an official. No, I don't agree with the fine, and I don't believe you intended to bump him, but I do believe that you had it coming. You've been doing stupid shit for quite a while, and the NFL is pretty much sick of it. You were not fined because you're black. You were fined because you're a repeat-offender. A white man in the same position would have gotten the same fine. And sadly, it's all about money. Billionaires arguing with billionaires makes those of us that don't have million-dollar contracts, hate you even more. And Tom Jackson on ESPN just said it best. If you don't like your boss (the NFL/NFL commissioner/team owners) enough to bitch incessantly about it? Find a new job. No one is making you stay. Go play in the CFL. I hear NFL Europe is hiring. Why not try the low-paying Arena League? Go get an office job where you make about 8-10% of your former salary. I don't care how good you are as a player. If I'm your boss and you go around calling me a slave master, then I'm firing your ass. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. Your refusal to be respectful of authority is enough reason for me. Those of us living in the real world wouldn't get away with it, and because you make more money than god, shouldn't mean you should get away with it either. So, Warren Sapp. SHUT UP! The more you talk, the dumber you look. Later... Okay, I just heard the complete interview with Warren Sapp. My comments above were pertaining to the last 30 seconds or so that I caught when I flipped to ESPN. Well, guess what? He wasn't talking about anything racial at all. Well, maybe he was, but that wasn't his primary gripe. He was pissed off because the NFL will not allow him or any other player to promote themselves on the field. His arguement? Professional football is about the players, not about the team. In the words of Gilbert Godfried in \"I Love the '80s...Strikes Back\", WHAT THE FUCK?!?! That whole \"there's no 'I' in 'team'\" apparently doesn't apply to Sapp. Just ask him. No, dumbfuck, you shouldn't be allowed to promote yourself on the field. You should be allowed to do one thing, and one thing only. Play football. If you're busy telling the world how awesome you are, then you're not playing football to the best of your ability, which is what you're being paid for. No, Warren Sapp, you should NOT be allowed to do anything you want on that football field. No, the game is not about the players. The players should be about the game. And on the field, the players should ONLY be about the game. And then he made the assenine comment that football is the most popular sport in the world but that nobody knows the players. Um, Warren? People outside of this country don't give two shits about football. Well, I take that back, they do, but we call that sport 'soccer.' Perhaps he's confused by the dual usage of the term 'football'. Soccer is more popular globally. Baseball is more popular globally. Hell, basketball is more popular globally. American football? Is just that...AMERICAN! Nobody outside of North America knows the players because nobody outside of North America cares even the slightest about the players. It has nothing to do with the fact that you wear a helmet. And trust me, Sapp, here in America, people know who you are, and they know your face because you're on television every 5 minutes bitching about something or other. I don't know, but if I'd been Michael Irvin and been conducting that interview, I'd have bitch-slapped you for that 'slave-master' comment. Because the way you went about explaining yourself told me (and others) that you didn't know what the hell you were talking about, and calling your boss a slave-master was just an uncalled-for low blow. You said it yourself that you just meant it was because they're your authority figure. Not because they treat you at all like a slave. The look on Irvin's face was one of shock and a little bit of disgust. So, I'll say it again. Just SHUT UP!! If you want more positive press, stop acting like a three year old who got his halloween candy taken away and play the fucking game. Knock somebody's head off, then keep your helmet on, refrain from the stupid celebratory dancing, get your ass back in the huddle, and play. The fucking. GAME! 11:17 am",

        "text": "Enough about that. Time for a topic change. I've liked horro movies for as long as I can remember. The first horror movie I can vividly remember is Friday the 13th Part IV. The Final Chapter. Rob and I were sleeping over at Adrian's house, and it came on that night. Actually, that's not true. I remember when we still lived in England. I saw American Werewolf in London. That absolutely scared the hell out of me, and it changed my life forever. After that I was hooked on horror. I have found that there are very distinct types of horror fans. There are people who only like zombie movies, while others prefer monster movies. Delineation goes on and on. Some monster movie fans are only interested in movies involving man-made monsters, while others prefer alens or newfound species. There are monster fans who devote their time exclusively to the likes of Godzilla. My point is, the genre of horror is so broad that there are innumberable movies to choose from with a variety of themes and character types. And that's what makes it all so great. If asked to sub-categorize my preference in horror movies, I would have to say that I am a diehard fan of gruesome humor. Gore in a humerous context is the best. Look at films like Evil Dead II and Dead Alive. Intelligently written, directed and produced, with scenes of gore that rival anything else ever made within the genre. I'm not a huge fan of zombie movies, but I can certainly appreciate what they've done. I mean, where would we be today without Night of the Living Dead? And talk about themes... watch the end of the movie and you'll know what I mean. Some would even say the killing of the black man at the end of the movie was symbolic of white oppression during that time (keep in mind the time at which the film was made). Great directors come from horror, there is no doubt of that. Some, like George Romero, will forever be bound to the genre. Others have moved out of horror and into the mainstream with great success. Sam Raimi, John Carpenter, Peter Jackson, all of these people have had extreme success in film. And here's a shocker that you might not know about. James Cameron. That's right, the one and only Titanic director who also rought us the Terminator got his start in the Pirhana series. Kind of funny, isn't it?",

What this usually meant was playing for 20 to 30 minutes at a time the same 2 or 3 chords rhythm while Brad soloed over it. We would come up with interesting little melodies, and some of them actually sounded pretty good. Once in a while we would remember to tape record them. I don't actually have any of those tapes, and I'm not sure if any of them do either, but it would be very interesting to hear what we sounded like. Brad had a Crate stack and a Peavey practice amp, along with a nice Ibanez multi-effects unit and an Ibanez distortion pedal, which I now have for some reason. Mike had a drum set that he had gotten for Christmas. He added cymbals later on. I had a Danelectro and no guitar amp. I usually borrowed one from Brad. It was fun to play because more than anything, it was fun to fuel our thoughts with what it might possibly be like to someday be playing in front of people, and be recognized.",

There were bones upon bones stacked in a large underground area. I was amazed that it didn't smell bad and it didn't seem particularly claustrophobic. We saw the Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triumph, and Notre Dame cathedral. We had an extremely hard time getting into the cathedral. The police had large areas of the grounds shut down because someone had managed to jump off the cathedral and commit suicide. I remember seeing the police cover the body with a large blue tarp. I don't remember seeing any blood but my dad saw the bodyand said it looked like the person had tried to land on their feet, and their legs were pushed up into their body. I remember eating a portion of a baguette in the hotel room. The only other thing I remember was almost being hit by a car while trying to cross the street. That's not true. Actually, I remember the Louvre as well. Even though I was a little boy at the time, I still couldn't believe how small the Mona Lisa was. It was enclosed in a glass case, and people were swarmed around it. I don't remember being particularly impressed by it, but that was mainly because I had the sort of attention span characteristic of little boys who would rather be in other places and doing other things.",

So, I'm sitting in bed, been reading my book forever. About one a.m. I hear THREE pairs of footsteps coming downstairs, and a knock on my door. Guess. Just... Guess. Marc and Stuart had snuck over, and David was wanting to know if I wanted to hang out. Sooooo happy. They went home in an hour, to make their parents think they were in bed and then snuck back over. We watched a movie Stuart really enjoyed. Stuart and I played \"footsie\" under the blanket, I loved having him close. I think he thinks I like Marc, and Marc should totally be out of the picture... but he's not, which kills me. Anyway, Stuart and I just kinda.. layed for a bit. I'm sure it didn't mean nearly as much to him but.. that seems to be the way that it always goes. After Stuart left... five-ish, David went to bed. Marc hung around for awhile later, against my wishes. It was pretty playful, though, like a big brother and a little sister wrestling. I got him pinned, mostly because he was laughing too much. It was a lot of fun, except he grabbed my chest a couple of times. It's Marc, what do you expect? Anyway, when I got him pinned he actually asked me something serious. \"Are you going to miss this?\" I was totally shocked. He was being sincere. \"Miss what? Me beating the shit out of you?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Of course. No other Allie will beat the shit out of you in Texas, you'll miss this.\" (pinned him down again.) \"There's an Allie in Texas that lets me grab her boobs.\" \"Good, you can mess with her like that.\" \"Why do you mind so much?\" \"You're leaving, Marc. You have a girlfriend. I don't see the point...\" The best news? Well, just take a look: Stuart: what are you up to tonight? TurnUpTheWeez: meh, just hanging out TurnUpTheWeez: yourself?

And you know what I would normally do in a situation such as this? I'd pick up the phone and call Ryan. I've picked it up three times today already and then remembered. I should just take his number out of my cell phone, except his is one of two numbers I know by heart, without hesitation. Taking it out of the cell phone will do no good. I should have stayed at his house. I shouldn't have come back here. I should have convinced him he could use the hidden spare key to get into his house so he didn't drive back to the office. Either that or I should have convinced him to take the long way from the office instead of the tunnel. I should have done something that would have kept him out of that damn tunnel. I should have told him the truth when he asked me that damn question back in August. He knew I wasn't, and I knew I wasn't, but neither of us did anything about it. And I shouldn't be mad at him for dying, but I am. I'm so incredibly angry and so unbelievably sad that I can't even stand it. 12:36 pm",

Her test results last week were positive, which, in this case is a bad thing. The latest ray of hope is that the doctor will re-run the test tomorrow to rule out a false positive. If it comes back negative, Julie will probably come home. If it comes back positive, she still might, but her OB and the twin specialist will have to come to an agreement. At this point, she is 30 weeks, and the doctors ideally want her to \"hold out\" (like any of this is up to her) until 34 weeks. In the meantime I am still doing my juggling act balancing work, the house, my daughter, and visiting Julie. Is sleep necessary? Everyone please think NEGATIVE! And then to top it off, I managed to arrange for a sitter for Katherine on Sunday (RTG), and Ben has the audacity of stopping at a stop sign / red light in front of a drunk driver, contributing to the cancellation of the session. Way to go dude! All kidding aside, I'm glad you're OK, and that the Honda lived up to its safety reputation",

        "text": "I think that running is akin to childbirth in some respects (not that I've ever given birth): while you're doing it, it's painful and terrible and you can't imagine ever doing it again, not in a million years, and you curse the bastard that got you into it in the first place (in running's case, yourself). But then it's over, and you have a shower, and you sit down to blog about it, and it feels great. Running, that is. My analogy ended in the first paragraph. You weren't still trying to make it work for this one, were you? Anyway, I didn't do myself any favors by not running for nearly a week. In case you're curious, a combination of factors including illness, DIY-mania, and heavy rain contributed to my sloth. Tonight I went out thinking, \"Do I really have to bother with the run-walk nonsense? Can't I just run out for 10 minutes, then run back for 10 minutes?\" The answer is no. I did the same run as before, and by the end of the second repetition I looked over at my house (which faces the park) and seriously considered running home right then, jumping the fence, and going in the back door. Then I remembered that my back door was locked (safety first, kids!) and that in order to get home I'd have to go back the way I came, round the corner, and down the road again. And by the time I thought of all the logistics, my repetition was over. Later, something funny happened on my 4th repetition: I started running, and suddenly the 3 minutes was over, just like that. I thought I must have shortchanged myself or read my watch wrong, but no: it just went like a hot knife through butter. Mmmm, butter. Ahh, that's the other thing. I haven't had much food today, which might have contributed to my near crash early in the run. I tried to eat a toasted bacon and guacamole sandwich for lunch, but someone really needs to tell the ladies in the canteen that guacamole should only be served ice cold. Hot guacamole is nastified. Oh well, at least there were pink wafers in the tea room.",

I'm sorry but I think its time to move on and find someone else that wants the job that will be able to sell everyday. I have called you at least 7 times in the new year and have not heard from you at all. I was a patient as possible and tried in everyway to help you along, I hope that you will find something that will be better for you. Boss Man Ok...had i got this a week ago, or for that matter, yesterday, I would have been devestated. (If it had have been the last few days, I probably would yammied all over the keyboard.) I mean, it's not snotty, but i definitely felt like i threw it all away. Not now. I feel like i made the right choice, underlined by the feeling of whoo i'm free...Freeeeeeeeeee..free to run down to the Baptist church the next town over and explain to them thatI would love to be a an adminstrative assistant to the Family Resource center. (I really would!) Of course, my dear Avid Reader, you may be thinking I'm off my gourd. Not so. The bills are taken care of till about Feburary. So, i have time. I hope it's enough time. I am aware it was perhaps idiotic to leave one job without having another one to run to, but it was to the point where i could not physically go to work. Nausea, wanting to drive the car off something or into something, a plethora of ill feelings and fears, not to mention my penchant for focusing on the negative; all of these things aided me in that helpless horrid feeling of my sanity unraveling. And, I feel I'm just putting my trust out There, and that makes me feel ok. Weird, right? I did a stupid thing, and I feel ok, becuase I'm trusting that I can find a better job, that i can do better then selling dishes. And I can do it before the safety net goes out. So, send mojo and happy thoughts my way.",

So although I filed my claim on APRIL 26TH they still haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t processed it. I sent them a nasty letter. I officially hate AFLAC. I tried to call my employer to find out what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on (because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pretty sure she would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve sent the paperwork) and she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not in today. That sucks. So then I called EDD about the Paid Family Leave that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m supposed to be getting, that was supposed to take effect on July 8th, and they had \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoo many callers\u00e2\u0080\u009d and hung up on me. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m supposed to get 6 additional weeks of paid family leave to stay home with my baby, BUT I HAVEN\u00e2\u0080\u0099T GOTTEN A CHECK YET AND MY SIX WEEKS ARE UP. Punks. So, in light of all these recent monetary set backs, our cell phones got turned off. And our cable. And our long distance. And our house phone. Yipee! I got the house line and long distance turned back on, and it looks like I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to have to cash out my 401K to get the cells turned back on. Cable can suck my toe. Marissa watches too much t.v. anyway, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t watch it hardly ever, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a big deal. I was starting to have serious reservations about home-schooling Marissa, and then she told me, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI WANT to go to public school.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Okay. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fine. So in order to get her registered I have to schedule a physical for her, and make sure her shot record is updated, and bring in a utility bill, and her birth certificate. School starts September 9th, so we have a little while yet. I just hope there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a huge list of supplies that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so hot that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sweating like a stuck pig who is sweating bullets. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sweating so much that my sweat is sweating. Yesterday we broke down and ran the air conditioner (the thermostat said it was 90 degrees inside). I had the air set up so that it would shut off at 80 degrees. It never shut off. So,we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re packing our bags and moving to Antarctica. (and did I mention that Marissa and I had the oh-so-bright idea of baking cookies today? Which means pre-heating the oven? You know, that contraption that can pretty much warm the house by itself in winter? Yup. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re obviously not the smartest people to ever walk this earth.)

Mir -- thank you very much for the invite, but I will have to regretfully decline as I will be in Los Angeles. Now, Mr. Shipley: 1) Mr. McVeigh ensured a seared national psyche by getting caught -- without the pulpit of the witness stand and the magnification of the media feeding frenzy, we (Mr. and Mrs. Joe Sixpack) would never have known that a small fringe group of dissatisfied citizens feels strongly enough about the state of our nation that they would resort to such a horrific statement. Perhaps now, we can identify with the British a little better. It's always a shock to find out that someone is so dissatisfied with the status quo they react with such a base emotion as violence. 2) Christians everywhere should never, ever forget that the Bible was written by the post-Roman Empire equivalent of the white-guy-of-european-descent. If you ever want a fascinating look at politics, read up on the politics behind the formation of the New Testament. What strikes me about the whole \"in his own image\" issue is what the 2000 year struggle between the teachings of Christ (love thy neighbor) and the age-old human nature (do unto your neighbor before he can do unto you) says about the image of God.... 3) I disagree with you on this point -- from our comfortably 21st Century agnostic-leaning perspective, it's easy to lump everyone who wasn't a native in the Puritan camp. Religion was much stronger back then, and our Founding Fathers found it as difficult to create the institutions of our government without God's influence as we would have today building an empire sans automoblie -- it's just so pervasive that it affects everything at such a level as to be inseperable. \"But what about the separation of church and state,\" you ask? The context there is the religious persecutions and bloodshed of the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries brought on by the merging of head of state and head of church (see Henry VIII's creation of the Anglican church for the start of that crap!). The Founders wanted a to ensure (wisely) that religion would not be used as state policy. They could not have envisioned a nation without God. Which is why they are all turning over in their graves at the recent \"Under God\" Pledge of Allegiance debacle. 4) Couldn't agree with you more on this one. Preach on, brother! 5) Mmmm-hmmm. 6) Would you consider the citizen of an empire? 7) Seems to me the only sure way to correct the media-induced self conciousness of women is to remake society as a matriarchy. Think that would do it? 8) Uh. Yeah. Words are like cool and stuff. Heh, heheh. 9) Are you offering advice to those designing AI? Seems a basic insight that would make things better for those poor saps. 10) Is that because everything is advertising, or is that because you are a crusty old CYNICAL bastard??? 11) Next to hot fudge sundae, of course.... 12) And I am grateful for your wonderful, meandering, barely relevant insights. P.S. Need everyone's help: I can't decide between \"What's He Got?\" by The Producers and \"Talk To Ya Later\" by The Tubes as an example the pinnacle of the New Wave sound. Thoughts?",

Plus I'm doing homework, PLUS I'm watching Law & Order...how massively talented am I? Well, my day was pretty kick butt. Umm, no band OR music theory...very cool, so Kristen and I sat together and did homework and discussed Winter. Next period I hung out with Chris and Kelly for a bit (Alex too for a bit, since he was in Gym) and I left eventually. They started working on music, and...I just always end up feeling left out when they do, so, I try to stay away from those two together in general.Oh well, I went and sat alone in a practice room. Darn...no good stories for the newspaper to write about me. That was a great story, no matter how angry people are about the band comment. I wish people would have read the story actually, instead of reaching paragraph two and deciding it was terrible. Well, anyway, umm...EPVM was interesting. I'm getting nervous about my final. My brother said it was difficult...my brother with the perfect ACT AND SAT scores...arg. I just...wow, I'm so afraid of that test. I'm completely going to fail. Gym...oh jeez...two words Commando Crawl OWWWWWWWWWWWWWW Good lord...that was one of the most painful...oh jeez...just thinking about it. Seriously, if you ever by some chance do that for high ropes...WEAR PANTS! Well, yes...wear pants normally, but don't wear shorts, make sure they are pants, because...it's quite painful if you don't. I made it through though, so it's all good! It just hurt...a lot. Math, boring, shock shock. Intervening thought: Why do I always write these while talking to Alex?? Lunch...was interesting. Just hung out with Kelly and Emily some, then Chris and Alex. It was cool...not much to it. Comparative Religion was boring...just, meh, presenting projects...and finally chem...boring, shock shock, and then, I came home, and did stuff, and that is the end of my day...therefore, I shall leave, and go kill alex...I mean...wait...you know NOTHING.

That song, and the dastardly creep creeping feeling that I'm flimsy, pretty babies. Evidenced here. My first missive to the revolution takes about two seconds to get into \"me me me\" territory. Would that Fitz were here. I may be wrong but I feel that we would form our own sexy archipelago of flamboyant \"freeness\" right next to or within the larger and more politically motivated \"freedom\". The freeness floozies. Making sure that the revolution stays well-accessorized and has enough margarita mix. Plus blingy gumball machine rings for every finger. Unity, bitches. But it's necessary. I should make this known now. I'm as unconcerned with the state of this country as I am with just about everything else that doesn't smudge my eyeliner or get in the way of me kissing cute boys. I'm the worst. Worse even than most teenagers are in this day and age. So worse I want to call myself, grammar police be damned: WORSER. But fuckit. I just should let you know that if the revolution and this sexy change we are discussing don't allow for me to have new Nike Air Force Ones every month or so. Well. I'm bailing. I gotta have something to march in. Happy feet make change, lovies. I'm not all bad and selfish things though. I should balance this caveat out a bit. Some of my more tasty realities. I have heart. I won't stand for being disrespected. I talk a gang of shit and I'm quick on my feet in a discussion. I know the best combinations of cusswords. I make stencils. I have two healthy middle fingers at the ready. I learned to dance, sexies, among angry black teenage girls. I'm fucking bulletproof when it comes to insults and sneaky armor chink pokings. I'm simultaneously intimidating and inviting as fuck. I feel quite alright breaking someone's head open with my largeness. I'm yer double triple four hundred times agent: no one's made a category for me yet. I cannot check one box on any form presented to me. I can tell you what sneakers look best with those fatigues.

        "text": "I could only admire you from afar Can never tell how I trully feel I'd rather be silent, alone Than to lose you forever Since I was in the early stages of my maturity, I have long searched for someone who would care for me. Often disturbed by the sight of have found themselves intimately, I strived to obtain a personal connection of my own. Because of the envy that consumed me at the time, I rushed blindlessly into the raging sea of affection. Not knowing the consequences it would have. And so it has engulfed me in its massive whirlpools of chance. Eventually, it drowned me in great depression as each opportunity failed. I was lost, confused, and even desperate. But soon I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve found out the irrepressible truth\u00e2\u0080\u1e0a that nobody could ever learn to love someone as hideous as me. Society, the same one who offered all ideas of emotional optimism, has created these conformities that forever embody sentimental cynicism and hypocrisy. As said in a movie, \u00e2\u0080\u009cStripes for stripes\u00e2\u0080\u1e0a Spots for spots\u00e2\u0080\u009d She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a stripe. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a spot. \u00e2\u0080\u1e0aWe could never be. Maybe I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m paranoid. Maybe I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m delusional. Or maybe I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m right. I have grown much, learned many things and known much about myself as an individual, as well as my emotional capacities to handle situations. But no matter how much I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve developed, it will never please people. A handsome face, a hot muscular physique, a nice sports car, wild sex - these are just a few things most people look for in a relationship. Is she one of these people - people who look for the real essence of being together when they are not content with their partner or they have not sufficed there bodily appetites. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve only met her for a few months. We have spent little time together and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still learning. Yet, my knowledge about her seems limited, thus disabling my abilities to fully please her. \u00e2\u0080\u1e0a \u00e2\u0080\u1e0a \u00e2\u0080\u1e0a This is hopeless! I am paranoid! I do not know how and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m constantly afraid of the consequences my actions can bring. I am delusional! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m hoping she will be with me as time grows and old and weary. Alas, I am right! I have no chance to at all\u00e2\u0080\u1e0a So I worship you from a corner, wanting to tell you what I really feel about you. However, the thought of losing you weakens me even more. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather sleep tonight crying Id rather be empty inside I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather be soulless Than not see you again",

        "text": "Now that I'm halfway through the year, time for some quick reflections on how\nthe blogging is going.\nFrom my sophomores, I'm getting some really high quality material. Given that\nthey are honors students, I suppose that's no surprise. Still, the best\nstudents are doing a very nice job of reflecting, of making connections, of\ncoming to insights. I ended up grading them on a portfolio method--I had them\nselect their top three blog posts, which I then graded (though given that I've\nbeen doing rubric- and standards-based assessment and feedback all semester,\nthe assigning of simple number grade for each post seemed really odd, and kind\nof inappropriate). I'm hoping to pick a couple of student editors to select\nthe top posts and work them up into an e-publication which I can post online.\nIt's the least I can do to showcase their efforts.\nI still, however, want to encourage student reflection. My plan is to\nincorporate this into the journaling period at the end of class. I have\nstudents do a learning log on moodle. Mostly it's just been a review of the\nclass, but I will start asking students to list \"seeds\" for blog posts (to\ntake a term used in the lower school here). I will also encourage students to\nhave a question in mind as they write, to avoid falling into mere summary.\nOne entertaining moment came when I showed students how to look at the blog\nstats available within blogger. Some were delighted, others terrified to\ndiscover that people around the world had been reading their blog posts. One\nstudent had a visitor from Croatia, another from Slovenia. One post on the\nclass blog came up near the top on a Google search on the justifiability of\nthe American Revolution. All very bracing, writing for a world-wide audience.\nI've been less satisfied with the work my seniors have done. I've gotten some\nexcellent posts, including an amusing take on what a Daoist blog post would\nlook like. However, overall, the posts have tended to be short, and in the\nnature of summaries. So I'm going to stress a few key points:\nThey should write steadily for at least 15 minutes. I find this helps in my own journaling.\nThey should aim for a minimum word count (250 is the _minimum_ I have in mind; 500 is better)\nThey should have a question in mind, either a question they come up with, or one of the thought questions on the syllabus\nAs with my sophomores, I'll work with them on \"blog seeds.\" And I'll stress\nthe goal of this exercise: reflection.\nHopefully, this will lead to even better results next semester. Certainly,\nsome of the blog posts I've read show the potential of the medium. Now I need\nto convince all my students to set their standards that high.",

        "text": "I tried my home-made tuna and tomato sauce. As I'd got a supply of tinned\ntomatoes I made the rest of the family a bolognese sauce at the same time. I\ncook for others like Beethoven wrote music - I have no idea what it tastes\nlike and cannot taste as I go along. It's all pure guess work.\nWe also obtained a pack of shallots - which are allowed but we very rarely\nuse. It was the last pack in Tesco's and reduced in price to 75p. I feel I\ncould do more with them - can you pickle them like onions?\nThat was about two weeks ago and I may still be suffering. I had severe tummy-\nache for several days following the meal. The Italian restaurants must be\nusing a magic ingredient that counteracts the tomato - perhaps olive oil? This\nneeds to be investigated further. I used about a third of the tin of tomatoes\non myself and gave the rest to the others.\nSo I cannot recommend tuna and tomato as a way of getting tomato into the\ndiet. However in case you have to cook bolognese sauce for the rest of the\nfamily when they refuse to share your sardine/mackerel/tuna and cabbage sauce,\nhere is what I did:\nbrown mince in rapeseed oil;\nstir fry some leek, cabbage and shallot in separate frying pan (and that\nformed the base for my own meal);\nadd the fried vegetables to browned mince, along with tin of tomato;\nadd a liberal dose of Italian herbs;\nadd a little bit of soy sauce;\nadd two beef stock cubes;\nsimmer and add some water from the pasta saucepan. If still too runny add a\nlittle flour to thicken.\nI did not taste this once but they assured me it was delicious - and I did not\ncatch them making faces behind my back.\nRAS",

        "text": "So for those of you that understand what those four letters stand for, you may\nunderstand why they have been driving me crazy over the last few days as I\nhave been creating some postcards for our upcoming promotional tour. I had\nbeen tasked with creating the promotional material and in order to print our\ncards we need to make sure the colors will look right when they are printed\nout, and it just so happens that they were far from that. It turns out one can\nlearn a lot more than just a little bit about colors when tasked with\nsomething difficult and at times frustrating...\nEssentially what needed to take place was small tweaks to the various color\nchannels (cyan, yellow, magenta, and black) in order to get our prints to look\nas close to natural as possible. Unfortunately ink printing displays color\nmuch differently than a computer monitor (red, green and blue blending) and\nthus I spent many hours hunched over my tiny computer adding a little more\nmagenta here, dropping the cyan a bit there and after several solid days of\nwork we have some cards that I am quite happy with! With anything in life\nthere will always be unseen difficulties that will come our way even when\nthings look great and I find this be prime great example of that. At first\nglance the image was great, all of the colors looked right but when the time\ncame to proof it with a print, nothing was as it seemed! Then I found out that\none of the most difficult colors to print out was a deep, saturated blue which\nonly made the task seem more daunting... The image we had chosen was a wide\nangle photo of the beach in Biarritz with lots of water and sky... As luck\nwould have it, I have never had to manage or deal with CMYK conversion and\nprinting like this so in many ways I was just as annoyed at the problem as I\nwas at my lack of experience or knowledge. In spite of the strikes against me,\na little determination, lots of trial and error and out came a product that\nseems to be worth the hard work!\nSo what would I say I have learned from this experience? Practically speaking,\nI found that I don't like CMYK very much, pictures look nice on a computer\nscreen and it is much easier if they stay there but I also found that I can\nactually accomplish what I set out to do even if it takes hours and hours of\nrepetition, minuscule changes and a few cups of coffee. If I were to bring God\ninto the discussion I would say that there is no situation that God brings us\nto that we are completely unprepared for. God does not set us up for failure,\nnor does He intend to disappoint us with the work that he has called each of\nus to. When I think about it, more than any frustrations or annoyances that\nmay have come up during the project, they are obscured by the excitement of\nhaving learned something new, accomplishing what I set out to do and liking\nwhat I have made enough to want to show it to others!\nWhile this may be more of a ramble about the practical details of my life, I\ncan truly testify to the goodness and faithfulness of God in how he leads all\nof us through life. He knows our talents, our passions and our limits. He will\nnever disappoint or abandon us, and while we may experience extreme challenges\nthat are beyond our strength or capacity to endure, in those moments He steps\nin to offer His strength to carry on. Early in this project we were running\ndry of ideas, having spent several days coming up with nothing and when we had\nexhausted all that we felt we had to offer we decided to ask God what to do.\nNo more than 5 minutes later we had an idea and began to move ahead, and\nwithin the hour the first card was finished and looking pretty cool if I may\nsay so myself.\nIn conclusion I feel that it is important to remind myself, sometimes daily,\nthat in accordance with the call of God I can do more than I may think I am\ncapable of, and my limits do not limit God but rather give Him the opportunity\nto shine through all the more brightly in my life!",

        "text": "Stocks on Bursa Malaysia closed in negative territory yesterday, as investors\nresorted to profit-taking after hitting historic high, while regional market\nwas weak with no overnight lead from Wall Street which was closed for a public\nholiday. The FBM KLCI fell 4.45 points or 0.28% to 1,570.04 after opening 1.43\npoints higher at 1,575.92. Market breadth was negative with losers leading\ngainers by 731 to 174 while 230 counters were unchanged. A total of 1.704\nbillion shares worth RM2.02 billion were traded against 1.907 billion shares\nvalued at RM2.201 billion on Monday.\nThe FBM KLCI opened 1.43 points higher at 1575.92 and hit the intra-day high\nof 1576.42 within the first fifteen minutes, thereafter, profit-taking\nactivities dominated the floor and pushed the key index to the intra-day low\nof 1567.91, before some late buying of selected blue-chips helped lift the key\nindex off low to close at 1570.04. Chart-wise, the FBM KLCI formed a bearish\nengulfing candlestick, a key reversal candlestick pattern, which indicates\nsellers were dominant throughout the day in pushing the key index lower.\nHence, the FBM KLCI is likely to further consolidate itself. Immediate support\nis provided by the 10-day moving average (MA) at 1568, which looks fragile,\nand the pivot low at 1558.\nMACD has turned downward, albeit still above its signal line, indicated a\nchange in the direction of the momentum and possible further correction ahead.\nRSI (14) fell to 68.8 from 72.8, indicated the market strength is reducing.\nStochastic is at 91.5 and has hooked downward, but is still above its slow\nstochastic line, reflected the correction of the key index. Signals from the\nindicators indicated possible further correction of the FBM KLCI in the near\nterm.\nThe FBM KLCI has closed below the 5-day MA but is just above the 10-day MA. If\nthe key index breaks below the 10-day MA, it is likely to slide further\nsouthward to the pivot support at 1558 and 1550. The underlying medium to\nlonger term uptrend, nonetheless, is still very much intact. Immediate\ndownside support zone is at 1566 to 1558 while the overhead resistance is at\n1577\\. The market is likely to see more profit-taking activities over the next\ntwo weeks as players lock in their pre Chinese New Year \"Ang-Pow\".\nOvernight, the Dow rose +50.55 points or +0.43% to close higher at 11,837.93.\nToday, the FBM KLCI is likely to trade within a range of 1557 to 1585.\nThis week's expected range: 1542 - 1594\nToday's expected range: 1557 - 1585\nResistance: 1575, 1580, 1585\nSupport: 1557, 1562, 1566",

        "text": "Welcome to the NFC championship edition of **Opposition Research**\n, where I'll be taking a look at the last team standing between the Packers\nand a trip to Dallas, the Chicago Bears. It's the first postseason matchup\nbetween the game's oldest rivalry in 70 years, and only the second all-time.\nGiven the enormity of the game, you'll be overrun with material within three\nclicks of a mouse. I'm not going to try to cover the whole game - there are so\nmany great articles out there. Instead, I'm going to highlight just a few\nthings that are of interest to me.\nBefore we dive into this epic Bears-Packers NFC Championship showdown, I have\nsome advice for Mike McCarthy and his team (because they\nHi, Mike.\nThrow out the game tape. Turn off the TV. Stop celebrating your wins over the\nFalcons and the Eagles.\nRelive the agony of outgaining the Bears by 103 yards and more than 11 minutes\nand still losing. Remember each and every one of those devastating penalties.\nRemember all the plays you _should have had_ \\- remember that drop in the end\nzone, Quarless? That 57-yard bomb you couldn't haul in, Jennings? And, should\nyou have had, Collins - three? How many sacks did you have, Clay - oh, right,\nnone. Say all you want about how this game was \"so long ago, and we've moved\npast it.\" Moved past it, nothin'. Get back **in it** , because **this** is who\nyou were last time you stepped onto Soldier Field.\nRecall that you had a lead, but you let a bad team stick around (and they\n_were_ a _bad team_ ). You let them stick around so long, they finally took\nwhat you'd been offering them with that winning field goal. Let that sink in\nfor a while.\nAnd, hey offense? You're not done yet. Go ahead and\n. Not a would-be 50 yard touchdown (Jennings), not a critical 3rd-and-4\n(Jones). And if you did manage to yes, Driver, I'm looking at you. I'm sure\nyou're still thinking about your four penalties, Bulaga - the only penalties\nthe team incurred - but I'd like to remind you, just in case you forgot. Oh,\nand Rodgers - that faux-QB-sneak-at-the-goal-line-but-really-I'm-gonna-toss-\nit-to-my-RB was great in theory\u2026probably looked fun on the\nchalkboard\u2026miserable in execution, sir.\nI don't say these things to be mean. I'm not trying to tear you down or\nanything. In fact, I'm one of your biggest fans. But with all the positive\npress that you'll be getting, with all the fawning and the hyperbolic praise,\nI feel like someone has to step in and remind you that this is no ordinary\ngame you're playing on Sunday. The Bears aren't any other team that you can\nprepare for with just the normal film study and then go out and execute. This\ngame demands so much more than that.\nwatching you guys pummel the Falcons. It does wonders for anyone having a bad\nday, believe me. And, please, feel free to pull out that tape in March, after\nthe season is over, when you're sitting in the sun somewhere and starting to\nmiss football. Right now, you should put that tape on the shelf, and take a\nfew hours to rewatch the last two Bears games. Realize that, had you won the\nfirst matchup, you would have gotten a bye and wouldn't have needed to be road\nwarriors in the postseason. Realize that you - every one of you - cost your\nteam yards, points, and yes, maybe even the game, in September.\nAnd, once you've watched it, strive to do better. Promise that you'll catch\nthe ball and hold on to it. That you'll make the play without a false start or\nillegal interference. That you'll help your team win a chance to play on the\ngame's biggest stage. That you'll play like you're capable of playing. Take\n_that_ onto the practice field and into the game on Sunday. This One's For All\nThe {Insert Your Favorite Chip Here}:\nYes, the Super Bowl will be watched by many more millions of people. And, yes,\n_technically_ , that game is more important in the grand scheme of football.\nHowever, this Sunday's game is the most important game to date in the Bears-\nPackers rivalry. Consider that, in 2007, the Packers lost only three games en\nroute to a first round bye in the playoffs. Yet, having the Bears sit at home\na year after losing in the Super Bowl didn't quiet Bears fans. Instead, they\nexulted about that, buried inside the Packers' gaudy 13-3 record, two of those\nlosses had come at the hands of their own team. \"Sure, your team can make the\nplayoffs, but you still can't beat the Bears.\" And so it goes.\nGiven the emotions that come from regular season meetings, it's no surprise\nthat a postseason meeting - as rare as they are between these teams - is going\nto up the ante all the more. After all, we fans\nalready jockey amongst ourselves about who has more Hall of Famers or\nchampionships or historical relevance or this or that. Monsters of the Midway\ngets mocked as \" see how the cities stack up:\n> Here's the thing Green Bay fans can't change no matter what happens this\nweek: their Green Bayness.\nIf the favored Packers triumph on the dyed-green, torn-up tundra of Soldier\nField on Sunday, fans all over Wisconsin will rejoice as if they'd been given\na lifetime supply of Gorgonzola, a Leinenkugel IV and 30 extra days to hunt\nwhite-tailed deer.\nBears fans will curse Cutler to the skies and call for Lovie's firing and\nchant \"Packers Suck!\" on their way out of Soldier Field - but come next Monday\nmorning, a new sports day will have dawned.\nAre the Blackhawks going to put together a winning streak and climb in the\nstandings so they're in decent shape to defend the Stanley Cup? With MVP\ncandidate Derrick Rose leading the way, can the Bulls make a serious run in\nthe playoffs and maybe even knock off the Celtics or the hated Heat?\n\u2026If the Packers lose on Sunday, what do their fans do, turn their attention to\nWisconsin basketball, the NBA's Bucks, the Milwaukee Brewers? Or do they\nimmediately start counting down the days until the next time they can hit the\nTundra Tailgate Zone?\nThere are a number of good articles about the\ncub reporters.\nAs Sunday approaches, I've become that much more convinced that this game have\na lot in common - spiritually, if not in outcome - with that 1941 playoff\ngame.\nThree times** as many people watched the Bears-Packers game as watched the\nNFL Championship the next week. That's what we're talking about. It's the kind\nof game that will, as **fans** in Green Bay, Chicago, and around the world,\nfor the rest of this rivalry:\n> The men who play and coach in this game will remember it, too, of course.\nBut, honestly, this one's about us. The people who comprise this game, they're\njust sort of passing through, aren't they?\nI really liked Chris's article, and I agree. A win on Sunday means more than\njust a Super Bowl berth, and a loss on Sunday means more than just an abrupt\nend to the season. If I'm being honest, I'll admit that a win on Sunday means\nmore to me than a win in Dallas. Naturally, I want both.\nI'll be watching the game in a darkened hotel room in Thailand, where -\nthoroughly jet-lagged, I'm sure - I'll set the alarm for 2:45am, slip into my\nAaron Rodgers jersey, and log onto my computer. And after the game, win or\nlose, I'll get ready for the day. Maybe I'll go for a run to wear off some\nenergy, maybe I'll just sit in the dark. But I swear - God help the Thai\ncompany officials I've come to meet with if the Packers lose.\n_The Bears feeling 'disrespected.'_ I talked about this before week 17, but\nit's only more pronounced now. SBN Chicago's Don Hamel\n> The Green Bay Packers, the _second place in the NFC North, visiting team\nGreen Bay Packers,_\nare the favorite. The oddsmakers must have been listening to every cable\nsports show on television, and subscribing to the Chicago papers. The Bears\nare the least respected number two seed since the U.S. invaded Grenada.\nDespite being one of the last four teams standing, the Bears didn't crack the\ntop four in Peter King's latest ranking of the \"\nFine Fifteen\" in this week's MMQB. I've heard no fewer than three Chicago\nradio announcers complain about this. Boo. Freaking. Hoo. . For the first half\nof the season, the Bears offense was off-kilter. Many chalked it up to the\nBears still learning Martz's complicated offensive scheme, which is predicated\non timing and rhythm (and usually works best with smart veteran receivers, not\nconverted defensive backs). Receivers were dropping passes, Forte was looking\nlost, and Cutler was coming out of a seven-step drop to be greeted by entire\ndefensive lines. Martz was adamant that his players would adapt. (Many fans\nwere adamant that Martz was off his rocker.) And then is still food for pass-\nrushers on occasion, but Martz's _refined_ _whether Cutler or Martz_ ) learned\nto play inside the system, however, you can always count on that one point in\nthe game where Martz will think, \"\n> At the end of the day, Martz's play-calling recklessness did not matter.\nChicago held on to win comfortably. But he did unnecessarily ignite a 21-point\nfourth-quarter explosion by Seattle that gave the game a much closer score\nthan the \"feel\" it had through the first 50 minutes.\nMartz could have snuffed out any lingering fire the Seahawks had left with a\ncouple first downs. Instead, he fueled the fire with a needless and reckless\ntrick play.\n_The Bears Defense Showing Up._** When Lovie Smith came out and said that\nthe cover-2 scheme was a huge part of his gameplan and \"would be around long\nafter he was gone,\" Aaron Nagler summed it up well: \"At least he's\nconsistent.\" Certainly, after all of the wrinkles, shifts, and exotic blitzes\nof a Dom Capers defense, you look at Chicago's defense and\nDanieal Manning** and FS **Chris Harris** Charles Tillman and **Tim\nJennings** take away the outside receivers using more man-to-man concepts.\nroams the middle (sometimes dropping), with help from LBs Pisa Tinoisamoa and\nLance Briggs**. Against the Packers, one of those two will periodically be\nswapped out for nickel CB **Julius Peppers** and DE **Israel Idonije** , stop\nthe run and go after Aaron Rodgers.\nYawn.\nThe Bears D is remarkably good at taking away the big play, which forces\nquarterbacks like Rodgers to rely more heavily on a short passing game (\nwill Rodgers fold under pressure?). They're also adept at punishing\nquarterbacks who get greedy or try to throw into too-small windows - their 35\nturnovers (21 picks, 14 recovered fumbles) is tied for third-best in the\nleague. And, in games against Green Bay, Chicago's done a nice job of keeping\nRodgers contained :\n> He worked within the limitations of the Bears' rejuvenated Cover 2 scheme,\nbut failed to expose it for consistent big gains, averaging 7.47 yards per\npass attempt, down from 8.26 for the season. He has little running game to\nrely on. The Bears gave up a total of 82 yards on 29 carries to Packers\nrunning backs this season.\nIt's not going to be a mystery that the Bears will line up with two deep\nsafeties while the front four guys try to get pressure. At the beginning of\nthe season, this type of defense wasn't of immediate concern, because a strong\nand fast tight end can be a \"cover-2 buster\" up the seam. Unfortunately,\nAndrew Quarless may have the potential, but does not yet have the ability,\nto take over that role:\nWithout the threat of injured TE Jermichael Finley, who he had at his disposal\nin his earlier trip to Soldier Field, Rodgers loses that fast, big body that\ncan outrun Urlacher to the deep middle of the field. That will free up #54 to\nhelp on underneath routes and in run support, where his athleticism is almost\nlike having a third-safety on the field at all times.\nIt's pretty clear to all and sundry that the Bears front four has its work cut\nout for it on Sunday. According to Lions OC Scott Linehan, Julius Peppers\n> Peppers has to get to Aaron Rodgers, period. At worst, he has to attract so\nmuch attention and induce false-start and holding penalties that helps other\nBears defensive linemen get there.\nthe way it always starts with Peppers, Linehan said.\nWhether it's Peppers or Israel Idonije or even Tommie Harris making a play for\nan unprecedented three weeks in a row, it has to be someone. Several someones.\nThe Bears have done it well enough before. They have to do it better now.\nHere's the deal: If Rodgers has time, the Bears have an early offseason.\nChad Clifton had a pretty solid game against Peppers in week 17, but struggled\nat times against John Abraham in Atlanta. I'll watch him early in the game. If\nwe see Peppers line up against Bulaga, we'll know Cliffy's doing his job.\n_Tim Masthay being either vilified or heralded on Monday_**\n_._ It's a cute story to say that the easiest way to combat a returner like\nDevin Hester is to not punt the ball. It makes you laugh a little. But it\nwon't happen on Sunday. The Packers will go 3-and-out, or a drive will stall,\nand the team will be forced to punt. After having a miserable day in Soldier\nField the first time, Masthay performed well against Hester in the season\nfinale, forcing numerous fair catches and only two reasonable returns. Still,\nyou have to Eric Weems' 102-yd TD return. In a strange way, it's not the\nworst thing that the Packers had a breakdown on special teams last week -\ntheir focus in practice this week should be evident on the field on Sunday.\nA Few Things I Think I Think:** (to steal a line from Peter King)\nJay Cutler looked brilliant against the Seahawks, particularly when picking on SEA S Lawyer Milloy (who was a Pro Bowler\u2026\nAfter playing against LeSean McCoy in the wildcard round, the Packers defense will have better luck with Matt Forte. McCoy is shiftier, but both are dangerous as runners and receivers. Forte is a threat, but I think the Packers contain him.\nthe more aggressive Capers is, the more likely I think we see Forte as an\neffective safety valve receiver.\nJay Cutler's new penchant for running will be on display again this Sunday. The Packers tend to have problems with running quarterbacks. It'll be annoying.\nGreg Olsen lined up against Charlie Peprah is a bad matchup for the Packers. Greg Olsen lined up against Clay Matthews might be worse. We'll see at least one of the two at least once in the game.\nSo goes Urlacher, so go the Bears. If Urlacher is effective early, it may be tough sledding for the Packers as the game goes on.\nI think the first to 23 will win.\nAre There Any Unknowns Left?\nThese teams know each other. After all, they've been meeting twice a year\nsince 1925. They're familiar with the personnel, their tendencies, their\nweaknesses. As experts have been spouting all week, it's\ngoing to come down to execution:\n> There are no tricks, no real window dressing to add to the game plan with\nthe Packers coming to town. Sure, a new package or two on offense and defense\ncan be added, but nothing that takes away from what you do best as a team.\nI find it funny that so many people have \"questions\" going into this game.\nfour questions over here. And, naturally, they are good articles, but it still\ncomes down to the basic question - is there anything left that these teams\ndon't** know about each other?\nI'm not sure the answer matters.\nBoth of the scouting reports I regularly turn to (\nreinforce what we know about this game: as Kevin Greene says, \" **It's a\nsimple, simple sport** .\"\nSo, What Happens?**\nI don't know. I can't wait to find out.\nAs a programming note, _should_ the Packers win on Sunday, there\nwill not be an Opposition Research prior to the Super Bowl. I may write\nsomething in the days before the game, but my being out of the country for\nwork until February 1 will make following news or team developments rather\ndifficult. Furthermore, with the likely exception of gametime tweets, the vast\nmajority of any Twitter updates will be of a non-football nature.

        "text": "A London-based former Tory peer accused of lying about his expenses told a\ncourt he viewed the system as being \"in lieu of salary\".\nLord Taylor of Warwick is accused of claiming for travel costs between a home\nin Oxford and the House of Lords, when he actually lived in the capital.\nHe told the jury at Southwark Crown Court that he had acted on advice from\nLord Colwyn that he s\nADVERTISEMENT\nhould state his address as being outside of London.\nLord Taylor said: \"It was in lieu of salary because there was no realistic\nprospect - because of the image of the House of Lords - of lords being paid.\nThe policy was to claim the maximum because the reality is, in terms of\nexpenditure, you were spending far more than you were able to claim back. This\nwas a contribution towards your costs.\"\nHe answered \"no\" when asked by Mohammed Khamisa QC, defending, if he had ever\nmade false claims for allowances or been in trouble with the police. Mr\nKhamisa asked him how he learned about the system for claiming expenses in the\nHouse of Lords. He said he remembered being given some very brief verbal\nadvice and a guidebook, but he relied on speaking to other members.\nLord Taylor said: \"We were told about the various categories and you discussed\nthose things with the other peers.\" He said it was made clear to him that\nexpenses were not seen in the typical sense, when people are paid back money\nthey have already spent.\nThe former Tory peer said: \"They were actually allowances. It was very\ndifferent to the House of Commons, because there you were paid, but in the\nLords you were unpaid. I very quickly got the impression that they were\nallowances in lieu of salary.\"\nHe spoke about a conversation he had with Lord Colwyn in 2003 with regard to\nhaving an address outside London. \"He said it was perfectly acceptable, but he\ndid stress you have to have a family connection,\" said Lord Taylor. He added\nthat Lord Colwyn was \"paternalistic\" towards him.\nLord Taylor told the jury that his colleagues in the Lords did not believe\nthey were misusing the expenses system. \"Not for a moment did I think that\nthey thought they were doing anything wrong because they weren't that type,\"\nhe said.\nLord Taylor, 58, of Lynwood Road, Ealing, west London, is on trial facing six\nallegations of false accounting on various dates between March 2006 and\nOctober 2007. The prosecution says he wrongly claimed for travel as well as\nnight subsistence. The trial was adjourned to 10am on Friday, when the peer\nwill continue to be cross-examined.\nCopyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2011, All Rights Reserved.",

        "text": "We have occasionally dabbled with educational lessons in past Themis Thoughts.\nWe have undertaken history lessons (SOES Bandits \u00e8 NASDAQ), physics lessons\n(optimal locations for HFT to collocate \u00e8 Hell), as well as lessons by example\n(think my wife's family at Thanksgiving). Today we move on to English lessons.\nSpecifically, we wish to illustrate the correct usage of irony, and\nspecifically how it finds its way into our beloved industry.\nIrony actually has several meanings. It can mean the usage of words to mean\nsomething very different from what they mean on the surface. A great example\nof this would be Jonathon Swift's A Modest Proposal, in which he advocates the\neating of babies as a solution to overpopulation in Ireland. It can also mean\nan outcome of events contrary to what was, or might have been, expected. A\ngood example of this is when Sarah Palin stood outside a slaughterhouse where\nturkeys were being killed in mass, on live television, while she advocated\nmercy, compassion, and giving thanks. But I digress. For today's Thoughts I\nwant to look at Irony in Wall Street, and highlight three examples of it that\njumped out at us just yesterday!\nCase One: Which Arnuk?\nIrony. A Financial website wants to explain the recent phenomenon on Wall\nStreet called High Frequency Trading. It wants the expertise of an Arnuk. No,\nI don't mean me. Although I have been breathing the issues surrounding high\nfrequency trading for a decade, the expertise that the financial website\nsought out (on its own) was that of my son, William. You see they found an 8th\ngrade civics class youtube video he made on high frequency trading last year,\nand decided that its was the best explanation of high frequency trading they\nhad seen anywhere. Click Here To See William's Video on HFT on\nPlusUltraTech.com\nCase Two: Pot, Meet Kettle\nPresident Obama grills President Hu Jintao on how his country (China) is\nmanipulating its exchange and interest rates. (Tim guffaws).\nCase Three: Kind of Like Appointing Charlie Sheen as Captain of Vice Squad?\nThe SEC, who fined Goldman Sachs $550 million to settle fraud charges just six\nmonths ago, just hired former Goldman Sachs employee, Eileen Rominger, to run\nits Investment Management Division (Wall Street and Technology Article). Yes\nyou read correctly. Now may I please have a hot poker to shove in my eye\nsockets please?\nCase Four:\nProfessor Angel from Georgetown, and frequent HFT defender, Enters the\nlobbying business by sending a brand new \"research paper\" to the SEC that\ndefends HFT on flawed principles and studies (Brogaard assumptions laughable).\nHe does not disclose that he wrote papers and books for Knight. He also\ndoesn't disclose that he is on the board of Direct Edge, the only exchange\nthat still flashes your orders! Ironic! Wait\u2026 this one is not ironic\u2026 it is\nexactly what we would have expected.

        "text": "Taking on Rauch's Call for Religious Accommodation in this Month's Advocate Se\nPacser (Or, French Civil Unions and the Law of Unintended Consequences)\nKangaroo Care and The Connection Between Parents and Our Infants\nMore Gay and Lesbian Families? Fewer Rights!\nJohn Culhane on Thursday, January 20th, 2011 This article in today's Times\npoints to census data establishing that there are more gay and lesbian couples\nraising kids in the South than elsewhere. In fact, the two cities with the\nlargest percentage of such families are San Antonio, Texas (34%) and\nJacksonville, Florida (32%).\nTexas and (especially) Florida are notoriously lousy places to live if you're\nLGBT, at least when considering the matter from the legal perspective. Both\nhave \"traditional\" marriage enshrined in their state's constitutions (with\nFlorida's also banning any kind of relationship recognition), and Florida law\nstill bans gays and lesbians from adopting. (The legal status of the law, as\nthe Times article insufficiently explains, is in doubt because a ruling that\nit was unconstitutional wasn't appealed to the state's supreme court. That\ncould still happen in a future case.)\nBut the story is a reminder that people's lives aren't defined by the law.\nAlthough the accounts are anecdotal rather than statistical, it seems that\nmany of these families enjoy support networks and are (to some extent, anyway)\nwelcomed by their communities. In their way, these people are doing as much\n(one might argue more) than all of the political and legal discourse about the\nrights of our families.\nAt the same time, it's also an invitation to continue to press for equality.\nThe story points out that these families defy the stereotype of the affluent,\nwhite gay and lesbian families that are (too) often the face of the marriage\nequality argument. And because many of them are in challenging financial\ncircumstances, arguments for basic equality under the law should be demanded\nas a down payment on the need for fuller economic and social justice and\nopportunity.",

        "text": "RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C. (Jan. 20, 2011)** \\- MCNC today announced that\n13 North Carolina Charter Schools are now receiving high-speed connectivity\nand services on the North Carolina Research and Education Network (NCREN).\nAll 115 K-12 public school districts in North Carolina were connected to NCREN\nin May 2009 under the North Carolina School Connectivity Initiative (SCI).\nNorth Carolina Charter Schools also were eligible to be connected to NCREN\nthrough the initiative either through a complete turnkey connection or to\ncontinue being responsible for part of the connection arrangements themselves.\nEach charter school connected to NCREN receives the same quality broadband\nconnections, equipment, and support as the school districts that already are\nconnected.\n\"The goal of the North Carolina School Connectivity Initiative was to provide\nevery K-12 student in North Carolina equal access to rich educational content\nthat can help prepare them for success in post secondary education and in a\ncareer. The SCI is the virtual aspect of the Career and College: Ready, Set,\nGo! vision,\" said North Carolina Gov. Bev Perdue. \"I am encouraged that\nseveral charter schools have begun to take advantage of the resources made\navailable through the SCI and to connect to NCREN.\"\nThis year will be the first full fiscal year of charter school participation\non NCREN.\nThe schools currently participating include: Children's Community School of\nDavidson; Charter Day School; Evergreen Charter School; Hawbridge School;\nFrancine Delany; Magellan Charter School; American Renaissance School; Bethel\nHill School; Lake Norman Charter School; Mountain Island Charter School;\nPiedmont Community Charter School; Union Academy; and Voyager Academy.\nVoyager Academy currently has 600 students on two campuses in Durham and was\nthe first charter school connected to NCREN in August 2007. Cory Draughon,\nhigh school principal, said a high school campus currently is under\nconstruction which will bring Voyager's total enrollment to 900 students - all\nof whom will have high-speed connectivity through NCREN to use remote\ndesktops, 1:1 laptops, and other high-demand applications.\n\"We are so excited about what we are doing today and more importantly\ntomorrow,\" Draughon said. \"Our confidence in NCREN makes connectivity an\nafter-thought. We never worry about it because we know it's there and running\nat the highest level; which allows us to focus on building the proper\ninfrastructure and educational content to benefit all our students.\"\nCharter schools last year served about 38,000 students, less than 3 percent of\nthe state's students. According to reports, as many as 20,000 students are on\nwaiting lists at the state's 99 charter schools, and the limit on the number\nof these independent schools may increase in 2011 after going unchanged for\nmore than a decade.\nUnion Academy in Monroe was the fourth charter school connected to NCREN and\nthe first with two campuses. Celest O'Brien, IT Director for Union Academy,\nsaid they have more than 1,100 students between the two campuses and faced a\nsignificant bottleneck on their network before being connected to NCREN.\n\"The 21st century tools and media rich technology that we worked so hard to\nobtain and integrate for high academic achievement over the last five years\nreally became difficult to operate because of bandwidth and network\nlimitations,\" O'Brien said. \"Through the School Connectivity Initiative, we\nwere able to connect to NCREN and efficiently operate these tools at necessary\nspeeds. But, it is more than just connectivity. The network assistance and\nsupport provided by MCNC's Client Network Engineers adds great value to our\nsmall staff. I recommend other schools take advantage of NCREN as well as the\nadditional services MCNC has to offer.\"\nThe SCI provides local school districts and charter schools with the\nconnectivity to NCREN, and through NCREN, to the commercial Internet and\nadvanced research networks, Internet2, and National Lambda Rail. The SCI also\nprovides local schools districts and charter schools technologies that help\nprepare today's students for the careers of tomorrow. The fast implementation\nwas achieved through collaboration among the N.C. Department of Public\nInstruction, e-NC Authority, N.C. Office of Information Technology Services,\nthe Friday Institute, and private-sector service providers including AT&T,\nTimeWarner Cable, Embarq, Frontier, and DukeNet.\nNorth Carolina's virtual education strategies mean that every citizen can\naccess educational content to gain a degree, hone their skills in their\ncurrent job, or prepare for a career change. The presence and proper upkeep of\nNCREN removes the barriers of access and geography as more than 2,500 K-12\nschools and higher education locations now have access to NCREN. Given this\nreach, the possibilities for teaching, learning, innovation, economic\ndevelopment, and social vitality will remain significant in North Carolina.\nAbout MCNC**\nMCNC is an independent, non-profit organization that employs advanced Internet\nnetworking technologies and systems to continuously improve learning and\ncollaboration throughout North Carolina's K-20 education community. MCNC\nprovides advanced communications technologies and support services that enable\naccess to 21st century learning applications and offers the opportunity to\nimprove teaching, learning, research and collaboration among North Carolina's\neducation community. For a more than a quarter century MCNC has operated a\nrobust, secure, exclusive communications network that has connected the\ninstitutions of the University of North Carolina System, Duke University and\nWake Forest University to each other and through advanced research networks\nsuch as Internet2 and National Lambda Rail, to the world. Visit www.mcnc.org.\nAbout NCREN Community**\nNCREN, operated by the non-profit organization MCNC, is one of the nation's\nfirst statewide education and research networks. It provides broadband\ncommunications technology services and support to K-12 school districts,\nhigher education campuses and academic research institutions across North\nCarolina. MCNC offers the NCREN network, technology tools and services to\nguarantee equal access to 21st century learning by providing a future-proof\ntechnology network that is the foundation for change and innovation in our\neducational systems. In addition to all public school districts in North\nCarolina, the NCREN user-community now includes: 17 institutions of the UNC\nSystem and General Administration; 24 of the 36 North Carolina Independent\nColleges and Universities; 58 North Carolina Community Colleges; research\ninstitutions and foundations; and, along with the N.C. Office of Information\nTechnology Services and other partners, MCNC will provide broadband services\nfor the Public Health and Non-Profit Hospitals Phases of the N.C. Telehealth\nNetwork in 2011 and beyond.\nAbout N.C. Charter Schools**\nThe purpose of charter schools to provide opportunities for teachers, parents,\npupils, and community members to establish and maintain schools that operate\nindependently of existing schools, as a method to accomplish all of the\nfollowing: Improve student learning; Increase learning opportunities for all\nstudents, with special emphasis on expanded learning experiences for students\nwho are identified as at risk of academic failure or academically gifted;\nEncourage the use of different and innovative teaching methods; Create new\nprofessional opportunities for teachers, including the opportunities to be\nresponsible for the learning program at the school site; Provide parents and\nstudents with expanded choices in the types of educational opportunities that\nare available within the public school system; and Hold the schools\naccountable for meeting measurable student achievement results, and provide\nthe schools with a method to change from rule-based to performance-based\naccountability systems. (1995 (Reg. Sess., 1996), c. 731, s. 2.)\nAbout MCNC's Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP) Awards**\nMCNC currently is working on a $146 million expansion of the North Carolina\nResearch and Education Network expected to be complete by 2013. This\ninitiative has been labeled the Golden LEAF Rural Broadband Initiative.\nTo fund this expansion, MCNC applied for and received two U.S. Department of\nCommerce Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP) awards totaling\n$104 million. In addition, MCNC raised $42 million in private matching funds\nas required by the BTOP program. MCNC's sources of matching funds included $24\nmillion from the Golden LEAF Foundation, $8 million from the MCNC Endowment,\n$4 million from private-sector wholesale telecommunications company FRC, and\nan estimated $6.55 million through donations of land and existing conduit from\nindividual community colleges, universities, and others including the\nAlbemarle Pamlico Economic Development Corporation. No direct funding from the\nState of North Carolina was required. MCNC estimates the expansion of NCREN\nwill create or save 2,500 engineering, construction, and manufacturing jobs in\nthe state.\nBoth MCNC awards are a part of a coordinated strategy developed by the Office\nof the Governor, the N.C. Office of Economic Recovery & Investment, and e-NC\nAuthority to improve broadband access for businesses and residents in\nunderserved areas. Once all work is complete, the two rounds of BTOP\ninfrastructure have the potential to serve directly, or through MCNC\npartnerships with private-sector service providers, more than 1,500 community\nanchor institutions, 180,000 businesses, and reach more than 300,000\nunderserved families.\nMCNC/BTOP Central Webspace**\nFor more information regarding all of MCNC's BTOP activities, visit MCNC's\nBTOP Central Web Space online.\nAbout the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction**\nThe North Carolina Department of Public Instruction provides leadership to 115\nlocal public school districts and 100 charter schools serving over 1.4 million\nstudents in kindergarten through high school graduation. The agency is\nresponsible for all aspects of the state's public school system and works\nunder the direction of the North Carolina State Board of Education.\nOther stories you might like:\nQ&A with MCNC engineer Tommy Jacobson\nMeet the Middleman: The quest for broadband in WNC\nFirst Look: NC Charter schools to see changes?\nThe longest mile: the quest for broadband access in WNC\nFirst Look: Apple adds Cherokee language to iPhone, iPod\nTagged as: broadband access, charter schools, high-speed Internet, MCNC,\nNCREN, schools, technology",

        "text": "By Bloomberg News\nJan. 20 (Bloomberg) -- China's growth accelerated to a more-than-forecast 9.8\npercent in the fourth quarter, adding pressure for more monetary tightening to\ncounter inflation.\nThe expansion reported by the statistics bureau in Beijing today compared with\na 9.6 percent annual gain in the previous three months. The median estimate in\na Bloomberg News survey of 22 economists was 9.4 percent. Consumer prices rose\n6 percent in December, matching the median forecast.\nChinese officials may keep ratcheting up bank reserve requirements and allow\nmore gains in the yuan after the currency strengthened to a 17-year high as\nPresident Hu Jintao visited the U.S. this week. The World Bank sees\n\"considerable scope\" for higher benchmark interest rates, with Citigroup Inc.\nand Credit Suisse Group AG estimating that inflation may peak at as much as 6\npercent in the first half.\n\"Growth won't be a problem this year,\" said Zhuang Jian, a Beijing-based\neconomist with the Asian Development Bank, before today's release. \"Inflation\nremains the top immediate risk for the economy.\"\nDecember's inflation compared with November's 5.1 percent annual pace, which\nwas the fastest in more than two years. For 2010 as a whole, consumer prices\nrose 3.3 percent, breaching a government target of 3 percent.\nOvertaking Japan\nChina's economy expanded 10.3 percent in 2010 to 39.8 trillion yuan ($6.04\ntrillion), the fastest pace in three years, the statistics bureau report\nshowed. That compared with 9.2 percent in 2009. The nation's standing as the\nworld's No. 2 economy may be confirmed on Feb. 14 when Japan reports gross\ndomestic product for the fourth quarter.\nUrban fixed-asset investment rose 24.5 percent in 2010 from a year earlier.\nRetail sales grew at an annual 19.1 percent in December, partly boosted by\ninflation, and industrial production rose 13.5 percent, the statistics bureau\nsaid. Producer prices jumped 5.9 percent.\nPremier Wen Jiabao pledged this week to prevent \"abnormal\" loan growth amid\nconcern that resurgent lending may add to excess money in the financial\nsystem, fueling asset bubbles and inflation.\nChina's foreign-exchange reserves jumped by a record $199 billion in the\nfourth quarter and new loans breached the government's target for 2010.\nCompanies from Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. to Starbucks Corp. and McDonald's\nCorp. have raised prices.\nPolicy makers' commitment to taming inflation means they risk \"overshooting\"\nand causing a slowdown that hampers the global recovery, Allen Sinai,\npresident of Decision Economics in New York, said in an interview in Tokyo\nthis week.\nThe central bank will increase the key one-year lending rate to 6.81 percent\nfrom 5.81 percent this year and let the yuan gain about 6 percent against the\ndollar, Nomura Holdings Inc. estimated this week.\nThe Chinese currency closed yesterday at 6.5824 per dollar, with President\nBarack Obama telling counterpart Hu that the yuan remains undervalued and\ngains so far have \"not been fast enough.\" Chinese Commerce Minister Chen\nDeming said U.S. export controls and China's role in global manufacturing\nhelped to explain the nations' trade imbalance.\nChina aims to hold inflation at 4 percent for the full year, state television\nreported last month, citing the National Development and Reform Commission,\nthe top economic planning agency.\nInflation of even that level is \"serious\" in China, according to Ma Jun,\nDeutsche Bank AG's chief China economist. \"People are used to low inflation\nand high inflation will easily cause social discontent,\" he said, citing a 1.6\npercent average annual rate for the 10 years through 2009\\.\nThe central bank has raised reserve ratios for the largest banks to 19\npercent, excluding any extra requirements for individual lenders. Still,\nlocal-currency lending has already exceeded 1 trillion yuan in the year to\ndate, the 21st Century Business Herald reported, citing an unidentified person\nfamiliar with the matter. Lending was 481 billion yuan in December.\nThe benchmark Shanghai Composite Index rose by the most in five weeks\nyesterday after speculation that the December inflation number had leaked and\nwas 4.6 percent, less than November's rate.\n\\--Li Yanping, Zheng Lifei.

        "text": "> Indianapolis 500 Centennial Tour enters its final stages For the past week,\nheroes from past Indianapolis 500 have toured military installations from\nGermany to Bahrain to Iraq to Turkey and finally Britain to visit troops at\nmilitary bases and an aircraft carrier at sea. The reason behind the trip is\nsummed up in a home-made sign in the corner of a window of the ICU at\nLandstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany \"Two small words mean a lot.\nThank you.\"\n\"This medicine is better than the pharmacy,\" Air Force Lt. Col. Rich Ciao of\nSan Francisco says about tour participants meeting of the wounded warriors at\nthe facility near Ramstein Air Base in Germany. \"This pharmacy doesn't cost\nanything and isn't dependent on chemicals. It comes from the heart.\"\nDavey Hamilton, who along with fellow Indianapolis 500 drivers Mario Andretti,\nAl Unser Jr., Sarah Fisher, Larry Foyt, Firestone Indy Lights race winner\nMartin Plowman and IndyCar Commercial Division President Terry Angstadt are\npart of the delegation on the 10-day tour of Europe and the Middle East, took\nthe time to talk to an Airman whose ankle was shattered while deploying a\nrobot to investigate a potential roadside explosive device.\nHamilton can relate after an accident in 2001 at Texas Motor Speedway nearly\ncost him both legs. With surgeons' skills and 21 operations later, Hamilton is\nnot only walking but competing in the IZOD IndyCar Series.\n\"It takes your breath away at first,\" Hamilton says. \"I could relate to the\nyoung man with the ankle injury. I was in my prime and had a lot of great\nthings going at that time, and to have it taken away in an instant is\ndefinitely a life-changing experience. I know what it takes to come back and I\nsee that in them - the willpower and dedication.\n\"The reason the Indy 500 continues is because of the freedom we have, and\nthese men and women are making sacrifices for us to continue to be free. Thank\nyou doesn't seem enough.\"\nAs part of the Goodwill Tour, a 2-seat IZOD IndyCar Series car with a\npatriotic livery and driven by Andretti gives some of the servicemen and women\na chance to experience the sport. Some of the riders are nominated by their\nsquadron commanders as \"unsung heroes,\" while others were selected through a\ndrawing in December.\nThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed in\nany form without prior authorization.",

There is no question that it represents an important first\nstep in the abolition of ObamaCare\u00a9. Frankly, though, it's something we've\nbeen touting all along, so it's surprising to us only that the new Congress\nfulfilled a campaign pledge.\nI do have some concerns about how one begins to undo the damage wrought so far\nby this train wreck. For example, will all those 20-somethings now be kicked\nback off mommy-and-daddy's plan? What will happen to groups and individuals\nwho've already renewed, and are (literally) paying the increased price? Will\ncarriers reinstate lifetime maximums and rescind first-dollar preventive care\nbenefits?\nAnd what about the few people that did sign up for one of the ObamaPools\u00a9?\nWill the states keep them in place until the cash cow runs dry, or simply fold\nup shop?\nMind you, none of these are earth-shattering in implication, but they are\npotentially messy loose ends that need to be tied up.\nOne last thing: despite the fact that it's now up to the Democrat-led Senate,\nthis vote was far from merely \"symbolic.\" The very best take on the\n\"symbolism\" comes from Cato's Mike Cannon:\n> \"The symbolism of today's House vote is striking. Within a year of\nObamaCare's enactment, the House of Representatives has voted overwhelmingly\nto repeal it.\n>\n> That didn't happen with Social Security. It didn't happen with Medicare ...\n>\n> Today's vote makes it more likely that someone with the power to scrap\nObamaCare will do so\"\nAmen, brother.",

See 13th Jan: Wanted: Team to do\nweekly online video bit highlighting a trope-of-the-week. PM but looking like\na pretty boy would be cool too.\nThis troper had this happen to him at least twice, in summer camp and in high school (and possibly once in middle school as well). Subverted in that he's pretty convinced they were only chasing him to mock him.\nYeah, that happened to me too. It was so annoying because I\n_wanted_ it to be true, but knew it probably wasn't (though I never did find\nout- stupid gutlessness...).\nThis one, on the other hand, didn't want it at all. In retrospect, that might've caused it in the first place. For that matter, they also ran the gamut of related tropes... If only he'd been a troper then.\nSame with second and thrid Tropers, she has a fact one to make fun of her due to being a soial outcast in her school.\nDitto with this troper; though he managed to befriend them by playing along with it.\nThis troper had as many as five girls interested in him at school - three of them highly attractive, and one of those a bisexual - but he didn't fancy any of them all that much. He also didn't even notice this until years afterwards.\nMissed Moment Of Awesome much?\nThis troper had two girls ask him to take them to the senior prom. Not sure if that works though, as they weren't really vying for my attention, they were just friends who wanted to go to the prom and didn't have dates yet.\nThis troper's younger brother has had this problem, although it's more of a hero-worship thing than an \"OMG I want to date him\" thing. Being as he is the star of his age group in swim team, he's gained a small herd of followers (who irritate him to no end).\nThis troper when he was in high school had this. There were several females at the martial arts school who had the hots for me. The problem with this? Well most of the girls were roughly 12 and 13 and when this happen I was about 17 years old. Yea not happening. Needless to say he ran into one of those girls years laster when she turned 17 and damn she got pretty.\nThis troper had this in sixth grade. With a bunch of eighth grade girls. They called me \"Hercules.\" Even now, I don't know what they found so attractive.\nThis troper currently has a boyfriend...and two girls that like me, possibly three.\nThis (bi, female) troper started out with a girlfriend...and currently has three bishonen guys who she's not sure what relationship status they consider her, but gets frequent declarations of love from and is involved with...(the girlfriend seems to find this whole thing amusing) Nevermind that if she thinks about being in a relationship with a guy too hard she'll sort of sit in a corner and whimper...I mean I love them all, but I really would've been fine with just the girl...I really don't know how this happened...\nThis troper, mostly by virtue of being a fairly attractive gamer girl. Many more people think that's hot than you'd expect.\nHave you not _read_ this site, above troper? Geekiness is hot. Full stop.\nThis troper's guy friend is going through this and this just started last year. All of a sudden, random girls kept coming up to him and tried to befriend him or kept calling him, \"best friend\" for no reason. Some of them were basically girls that just flirt with certain guys to piss whatever girl was closest to them (and boy did it work on me). It seems that he really doesn't care for any of those other girls. Also, at the residential camp this troper went to recently, this girl that I quickly became friends with, went through this. Two of the guys at the camp crushed on her and were just obsessed about it. She couldn't stand any of it.\nThis troper had one back at his old school. Two young, plain looking, overweight, goofy brunette girls who would always giggle around him and make him sit with them. However, towards the end of the year, he grew fond of them, and somewhat misses them now...* Sighs*\nThis troper currently has this going on for him. He knows at least about 1 girl in his circle of (entirely female) friends has had a crush on him before(And another that he suspects might have a crush on him, though various hint-dropping.) He's also met four females on Skype, all of whom either flirt or fluster him on a regular basis and seem to slip into what this troper likes to call 'Rena Mode' on him. One these involved somehow charming a woman over in less than a\n_day_. And _then_ there was the time this troper accidentally got roped into\nroleplaying with a mother from Sweden who was.. Even The Guys Want Him, due to\na few of this troper's male friends reacting in that manner. One of this\ntroper friend's attributed this to this troper's lanky frame, messy hair,\nkind, easily-flustered, nice guy personality, and what he called _soul-\nstealing blue eyes_. This troper would like to note that this has only\nhappened in the span of about a year, and wasn't even looked at like that\notherwise, prior.\nThis Troper had six girls crushing on him, four of them actively pursuing him and asking him out even, all during the same year of his life. Unfortunately what they took for sensitivity was simply me not sexualizing them whatsoever because this Troper is gay yet was closeted during this year. As one can guess none of the pairings happened in the end, even though other friends, siblings, and even parents were shipping them.\nThis Troper was part of one. As a student, and then a teacher, of a foreign languages, she attented classes where the female-to-male ratio varied between 6-to-1 and 10-to-1. Needless to say, the rate of celibacy was lower among the male students than among the females.\nThis (female, somewhat closeted bisexual/not entirely straight/something) Troper had an unwanted harem of all but one her closest friends- was molested by her ex-\nheterosexual life partner, asked out by said lifepartner's boyfriend while\nthey were still dating, was told recently by another friend that she was\ntrying to get with this troper all junior year, and has the feeling that her\nBlack Best Friend wouldn't exactly be opposed to going out... The most\nupsetting part is that the only friend who this troper really does like\ndoesn't seem interested.\nOne day in eighth grade, all the girls in my grade came over to my table and said they were my friends now. One of them gave me her box of Cheez-its. Within a year or so, I realized that for most of them, this was just their scheme to get me as their pet to sic on the other guys, all of whom avoided me like the plague and would often run away from me in semi-serious fear to avoid accidentally making any kind of physical contact.\nPoor kid at my school is bugged by me and my friends. We poke him. And just generally bug him. Plus, he has now earned the nickname of Princess. Like, last quarter, one teacher actually called him Princess Kwon Kwon.\nTsunderes, one of which was the troper herself. And there was also the\ntroper's female classmates who would (jokingly) profess their love to the\nfriend on a daily basis. This all reached a point where the Manipulative\nBastard would regularly run over to hold the friend's hand, the other Tsundere\nlugged around a sign reading \"I love you [friend]!\", and this troper and the\nfight over the friend.\nThis Troper (probably a Type B male\nTsundere) seems to have this going on. Between the girls who constantly hit on\nand flirt with him, the Type A Tsundere girl I hang out with regularly, the\ngay option, my life is practically a romantic comedy at times.\nThis troper emphasizes the word \"Unwanted\". I despise having relationship with females,\n, yet in my own house only two of us were male (Me and my father) while the\nrest who lives are female, from a relative Tsundere who has a Moe Moe sister\nto three maids from the Philippines, and it's even worse in school, where some\ngirls are attracted to me (including Koreans), yet I do nothing but reject\nthem and speak openly and shamelessly against females, romantic relationships\nand marriage like I was a Nietzsche Wannabe. I don't know, I look like a\nstereotypical geek and I don't want any females near me because of my usually\nTroper, Tsundere, Otaku and Nietzsche Wannabe attitudes, which I fear is\nharmful to others, but maybe the reason I have an Unwanted Harem is because I\nam one of the school nerds who almost always end up being beaten, bullied,\nharassed and mind raped by the jocks .\nThis troper has to live in one daily as a good majority of her friend's group consists of skirt-chasing guys and lesibeans with no sense of personal space. Despite what others may think, it is most unwanted and this troper does not want, especially when she's referred to as the cute one and then smothered in their affection or thrown over a shoulder and 'kidnapped.'\nThis 9th-grade Troper thinks they're messing with me, but I seem to be fancied by 10th-graders and black girls. Unfortunately, the 10th grader is perverted and unatractive. I was playing basketball with my friends in gym class and she yells, \"Take your shirt off!\" I didn't try to let her down easy. A girl in my math class, though having a nice enough personallity towards me, did a lot of things against my values. She often would sit by me and smile at me. As for the black girls, whoo-boy. This might be wanted, except that I can't tell if they really like me, are messing around, or just very friendly. One says hi to me wheverever she can and puts an emphasis on my name, a few randomly sit by me at lunch and ask me random questions, and one particulary attractive girl tried to hug me. I refused because of my antisocail attitude an, well, I don't think I was wearing blue jeans that day.\nNot sure if this counts, but after years of being ignored by the opposite sex,\nThis Troper suddenly found that three of her male friends were obviously\ninterested in dating her. It was...jarring, to say the least, not to mention a\nlittle frustrating since she had just moved a hundred miles away from the one\ninterested male that she would have considered dating. Inverted by this\nTroper, who would _love_ such a situation, but girls completely unrequire his\nfeelings. I even wonder what's bad about having girls chasing after him....\nYes, I would swap with everybody here, why do you ask?\nJoin the club. I'll get you a jacket and a nametag.\nThis Troper has it somewhere between subverted and reconstructed, going by the Played With thing on this page. I have a great many female friends, (almost) none of whom are romantically or sexually interested in me, which I know because I've asked. In each case, they either gave a polite no or a polite \"not anymore.\" Still, they're all good friends who I am happy to have as friends.\nHilarity Ensues when attempting to convince almost anyone who sees me with one\nof them (or anyone who's seen me with several of them) that Chivalrous\nPervert. Also, most of them aren't friends with any of the others.\nThis (male) troper just realised his life is slowly becoming one. He has his girlfriend, then his three closest friends happen to be girls (one of which seems to be crushing on him already...), and a girl who's name I don't know (she has approached me three times, once to ask me to a dance). This troper, in summary, isn't sure to be happy or otherwise.\nUnlucky Everydude... until the month before I moved to a different city at\nwhich point I suddenly acquired one of these. FUCK.\nThis Troper was a major aversion. In 8th Grade, he sat at a lunch table with him as the only boy. He just sat there. Eleven girls around him. However, none of them had any interest in him. At all. Although they were very comfortable around him, once spending an entire recess period speaking of Milkshakes. Not the kind you drink. Its a wonder he didn't change where he was sitting after that.\nUnwanted Harem\" but a few moments in middle school, wherein he was around a\nfew girls at a time who wanted to talk to him (again, not necessarily a matter\nof attraction, could be about friendship, etc...) could easily be mistaken for\nit. The problem with this concept is that it's hard to tell whether it's\nactually a matter of attraction or not.\nThis troper is part of a fencing club that has members of all ages and abilities. A few of the younger girls, this troper included, decided to embarrass one of the internationally-ranked men in the club by pretending to be this trope (oddly enough, no one had a problem with 3 underage girls were fawning over a 50+ year old man). This snowballed to include all the other members of the club, the instructor included, and even eventually members of other local clubs. One notable instance was when he walked in late to a tournament, only to have nearly everyone, even the guys, stop for a moment to admiringly coo his name. He also reportedly had a panic attack while at a tournament in Russia when two young girls asked for his autograph; he thought the \"fan club\" was spreading beyond just our local area. Lucky for him though, the girls were just asking for the autographs of all the fencers at the event.\nI applaud you for this.\nThis overweight, glasses-wearing\nKavorka Kid was in gym class in junior high when we had to invent a dance\nroutine. While I was deciding what group I wanted to be in, Half the girls in\nthe class surrounded me and declared I was in theirs. To this day, I'm still\npopular with girls and I'm not really sure why (there's also the fact that I\nnow have a girlfriend, and having girls who seem to fawn over me makes both of\nus kind of uncomfortable.)\nThis female troper really can't figure out how it happened: In junior high I was merely a wallflower, but the second I started high school I got two boys of my own age, one senior student, and\none bisexual female student onto my heels and needless to say, I'm not\ninterested in any of them...though I like the attention I'm getting. Me when I\ngot a girlfriend. Suddenly, everyone realized that I'm NOT totally hopeless\nwith women, even though it took me until the beginning of my senior year in\nhigh school to get a girl, and I became much more attractive. Of course, I\nhardly wanted to dump Kelly just because two bisexual nymphomaniacs and my\nsuper-hot best friend are trying to bang me. So over a year later, Kelly and I\nare still together. I'm an idiot, right? First girl won. (As a side note, all\nyou people are lucky, lucky bastards.)\nI finally have me a girlfriend...then it turns out she isn't over her ex. ok, so we quietly break up. No big deal. A few weeks later I get a crush on one of her friends who was mine as well. She wanted to tell me a secret that she liked someone. Who was it? my former girlfriends ex as well. I then talked with another girl who was my friend and she too said she had a crush on him. The guy in question is heavily monotone and doesn't want to be touched at all. Hugs, kisses, you name it. He does however recite shakespeare and has the voice of a less\nThis troper is a slight subversion in that he was friends with a guy who had\none, and the entire school recognised this. Even though one of their group was\ndefinatly his girlfriend. And he still went to me for advice when he was\nhaving trouble with that relationship, even though I have absolutley no\nexperiance in the field of girlfriends, mostly because he saw me being\nfriendly with all the other girls in his harem and automatically assumed I was\ngood with that sort of thing. Everyone else, not so much.\nThis troper has a group of girls that constantly ask for hugs from him, even getting\nglomped from time to time. This was very awkward at first, but I don't mind\nanymore. Kind of subverted in the fact that none of them are interested in me\nas far as I know. Of course, this isn't saying much.\nI had some sort of thing in which whenever I started to befriend or (even worse) begin to fancy a certain guy, they suddenly were in the middle of an\nHarem Nanny since I was an active participant in a few of the cases (in one I\nwas the Take A Third Option since I never expressed any interest outwardly)\nbut it was more like...well it was either a Harem Launcher or a case of having\nsome horrible friends in high school who didn't want me happy in love.\nPlaying with the trope over here. I like to be part of the harem and round it off. I can be the funny one, the quiet one, the letch, the sporty one, or even the nanny. Of course, I'm never in just one at a time so people who know me don't take my participation very seriously. Of course, I do often drop out when the harem reaches its critical mass and my efforts are best turned elsewhere (four of us is way better than three but five isn't much better than four. Of course, one must take the levels of commitment into account. The more committed the other harem blokes are, the shorter I'll be around). I've never won but it's not as thought I want to. For those of you who are going to get on my case for toying with people's emotions, I think that having a skillful \"harem tiller\" can actually make things more exciting and fun for all involved. The competition also causes the more determined guys to... shit, I just realized, as I was writing this, that I am a Paolo. Damnit.\nThis troper had a friend in high school who had the BIGGEST.\nFUCKING. HAREM. she's ever seen. He was extremely good-looking, played five\nmusical instruments and was overall funny and charming. Random women stopped\nin the middle of the street to compliment his appearance. When going to a\nclub, he spent the entire night fending off girls. Seriously, I've seen it. A\nfriend of this troper claims to have developed an eating disorder so he would\nnotice her. He had a fan club of thirteen-year-olds following him around and\ntaking pictures of him to drool over them during classes. (He was eighteen at\nthat time.) They also baked him cookies and begged him for hugs. And this\ntroper admits that she was madly in love with him as well. The kicker?",

        "text": "Swedish Vallhund\nThe **Swedish vallhund** is a breed of dog. It is believed that the Swedish\nvallhund distinguished itself during the age of Vikings, more than 1,000\nyears ago. Known as the \"Viking dog\", the vallhund were bred to herd cattle,\ncatch vermin (such as rats), and guard the home. The vallhund were also\nreferred to as \"the little cattle dog of the Vikings\".\nSwedish Vallhund Appearance\nThe **Swedish vallhund** are a powerful, fearless, watchful, energetic, alert,\nintelligent, friendly, and healthy small breed of dog. They have few known\ngenetically inherited health issues, and are considered hardy, healthy and\nrobust with a good long life span of typically over 14 years. Swedish\nVallhunds are suitable as working farm dogs and as companion pets. They fit\nwell into the rural lifestyle and suburban living.\nSwedish Vallhund Size and weight\nHeight for **Swedish vallhund** little dogs at withers : Dogs 33 cm. Bitches\n31 cm. A variation of 1.5 cm above or below these heights is permitted. Weight\n: Between 9 - 14 kg or 19.8 - 30.8 pounds.\" They should be strong for their\nsize and have a muscular body. They are quite a substantial dog, with short\nlegs.\nSwedish Vallhund Color and coat\nThe dog's coat should be of short to medium length, and harsh. The topcoat is\nclose and tight and undercoat is soft and dense. The hair is short on the head\nand on the foreparts of the legs, while a little bit longer on the neck, chest\nand back parts of the hind legs. Desirable colours are grey, greyish brown,\ngreyish yellow or reddish brown with darker hairs on back, neck and sides of\nthe body. Lighter hair in the same shade of colour as mentioned above can be\nseen on muzzle, throat, chest, belly, buttocks, feet and hocks. Lighter\nmarkings on shoulders, so called harness markings, desirable. White is\npermitted to a small extent as a narrow blaze, neckstop or slight necklace.\nWhite markings are permitted on fore-and hindlegs and on the chest. White\npatching that exceeds more than 30% over the overall coat coloring is\nconsidered a fault.\nTemperament\nThis breed makes a great companion and can also be used for herding and\nratting. They love human attention and are very devoted to their owners. They\nare a clownish type dog and can be a show-off at times. The Swedish vallhund\nis responsive and even-tempered with most people, but they can be wary of\nstrangers and should be properly socialized and trained as a puppy as to avoid\nover-protective behavior as an adult. They will try to guard your home even if\nthey are three sizes too small, so to say, for the job at hand. They are also\nknown for heel nipping due to their inbuilt herding traits. This is a habit\nthat can either be encouraged for working farm dogs or discouraged in\ncompanion pets.\nSwedish Vallhund Activities\nThe **Swedish vallhund** can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, Rally\nobedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding\ninstincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests.\nVallhunds that exhibit basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in\nherding trials\nLabels: S Dog Breeds",

        "text": "Director has worked with Madonna and Lady Gaga in the past.\nBy Jocelyn Vena\n_Britney Spears_\n_Photo: Getty Images_\nThe Lady Gaga vs. Britney Spears battle continues now that Gaga's \"Telephone\"\nvideo director, Jonas \u00c5kerlund, has been tapped to direct Brit's \"Hold It\nAgainst Me\" clip.\n\"Dance, dance, and more dance,\" she tweeted Monday about working with the\nveteran music-video director. \"Getting ready to shoot the video for HIAM this\nweek with Jonas Akerlund. Super excited!\"\n\u00c5kerlund has directed a number of controversial videos over the course of his\ntwo-decade career. The Swedish auteur achieved mainstream success when he\njoined forces with Madonna to direct her video for \"Ray of Light\" in 1998. The\nduo reunited in 2000 for \"Music,\" starring then up-and-coming comedian Sacha\nBaron Cohen, and they courted controversy in 2003 with Madonna's dark\n\"American Life\" clip.\nHe later worked with Madge on \"Jump\" in 2006 and \"Celebration\" in 2009. He\nalso directed Madonna in the 2006 documentary \"I'm Going to Tell You a\nSecret,\" which chronicled Madonna's experiences during her Re-Invention World\nTour.\n\u00c5kerlund hooked up with Gaga in 2009 for her cinematic \"Paparazzi\" clip, which\nstarred \"True Blood\" star Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, but the duo stepped up their\ngame in 2010 with Gaga's over-the-top \"Telephone\" video, which featured a\nprison break, a mass murder and \"Thelma & Louise\" undertones.\nPrior to working with pop queens like Spears, Gaga and Madonna, \u00c5kerlund made\nheadlines and gained quite a reputation as a provocateur making videos for\nMoby's \"James Bond Theme\" and the Prodigy's \"Smack My Bitch Up.\" \u00c5kerlund's\nother big videos include Metallica's \"Turn the Page,\" U2's \"Walk On,\"\nChristina Aguilera's \"Beautiful\" and Pink's \"Sober.\"\nWhile details are scant as to what the \"Hold It Against Me\" video will look\nlike, it's being reported that the costuming will be done by Falguni & Shane\nPeacock, who have worked with Katy Perry, Fergie and Cheryl Cole. They will be\nworking on Indian-inspired costumes, according to Brit fan site\nBreatheHeavy.com.\n\"Britney's manager contacted us and we exchanged some e-mails with her about\nstyle and fashion. We sent sketches of our models to Britney and she chose the\nones she liked the most,\" Falguni told the site. \"Britney wanted to experiment\nwith our style. She will be seen wearing a long black dress with pink and red\ndetailing.\"\nIn other Spears news, not only should fans be excited for the video, but \"Hold\nIt Against Me\" producer Dr. Luke also teased fans about the singer's second\nsingle. \"Britney's 2nd single gonna be fire!!!!!!\" he tweeted. \"Watch\nout!!!!!!\"\n_What are you expecting from Britney's new video?

        "text": "New year, new record\nKAREN BAILEY AND TERRY SIM\nTHEY say a week is a long time in politics, but at the moment the expression\nalso rings true for the lamb market.\nLast week The Land reported lambs hitting a national record of $206 a head at\nForbes.\nBut in the past week the bragging rights have been shared between a number of\nsaleyards - Wagga Wagga last Thursday at $206.50, Bendigo in Victoria on\nMonday at $207, Forbes on Tuesday at $209, before a late sale result from\nBallarat, Vic, stole the title with a $210 high.\nForbes this week snatched back the NSW record price from Wagga with a pen of\nextra heavy lambs which sold for $209 a head on Tuesday.\nThey were pasture-finished, second-cross lambs (by Dorset rams) sold by Noel\nPengilly and family, Glenleigh Partnership, Eugowra, and bought by Southern\nMeats at Goulburn.\nThe past week unfolded with Wagga claiming the record just two days after\nForbes, but not to be outdone, it seems the Victorians were determined to keep\npace and on Monday the record fell again when lambs at Bendigo hit $207.\nThe Bendigo pen of 102 lambs, with an estimated carcase weight of 33 to 34\nkilograms, was sold by Rochester, Vic, graziers, Gerald and Jacob Ryan.\nSelling agent, Chris Nevins, F.P. Nevins and Company, Inglewood, said the\nlambs were bought by Swift Australia.\n\"I always hoped I would sell lambs for more than $200 but never thought it\nwould happen,\" Mr Nevins said.\nHe estimated the Bendigo market was at least $10 to $15 dearer than last week.\n\"I don't think the market will get any dearer now - but then again we said\nthat last week,\" he said.\nThe final mark of the pen was at Ballarat where 111 heavy lambs climbed to\n$210 a head.\nT.B. White and Sons director, Gerard White, Ballarat, said the lambs were\nestimated to weigh between 32kg and 33kg and were second-cross by Dorset rams.\nThey were sold by the Sobey family from Ascot near Ballarat and bought by T.\nand R. Pastoral.\nAnd there may be more high prices on the cards as saleyards jostle for the\nnational record bragging rights.\nTalk among agents at some NSW centres (who did not want to be named) suggested\nthey are keen to keep the record from settling in Victoria - while there was\nalso speculation the record price could be challenged again at Wagga today.\nAt the same time sheep prices are also heating up.\nLast week's big deluge across Victoria didn't dull the demand for quality\nfirst-cross ewes at Ballarat where prices hit a new record high of $316.\nVictorian breeder, Robert Fraser, Glengower, sold 227 June/July 2009-drop\nOctober-shorn ewes through Crawford Dowling auctioneer, Barclay Dowling, to\nGraeme Dehnert, Ballan, Vic, for the new national record price of $316 a head.\nThis was $113 higher than the top price at the sale last year and came only a\nweek after first-cross ewes made to $307 at the annual Kyneton sale.\nMr Dehnert said he was expecting to pay $280, but had no hesitation in paying\nthe premium because the ewes were OJD vaccinated and mulesed.\nHe said the ewes would be joined to his Fernhill stud Southdown rams and he\nwould \"get over\" paying the new national record.\n\"It's no good being the richest person in the cemetery.\"",

        "text": "I've just finished reading the revised edition of \"The Paleo Diet\" and\ncouldn't help notice that the word lean is used on almost every page. His\nargument that paleo animals were naturally leaner than modern food animals -\nwhether grass or grain fed - seems fair enough; and similar to the point that\nmodern fruit varieties are much sweeter than in the past.\nBasically, people here get hungry without fat, and animal fat is the most\npaleo form of fat there is.\nAre wild animal leaner than grain finished animals? In many cases, yes. Do you\never see any of that extra grain fed animal fat at the supermarket? No, it's\ngets trimmed off and thrown out before the meat gets packaged.\nDo you ever see any of that extra grain fed animal fat at the supermarket?\nNo, it's gets trimmed off and thrown out before the meat gets packaged.**\nNot in my market - all my meat has a lot of fat - except the bull fighting\nmeat\nPaleo man is unlikely to have thrown away perfectly good animal fat, the way\nmodern man does.**\nTrue, wild animals are leaner. There are fatty portions of lean animals. But,\nCordain assumes that paleo people only ate the lean parts of the animal. Did\npaleos eat only the breats of chickens, without the skin? Or did they eat the\nthighs, legs and back too?\nThe one argument in favor of Cordain's position is that modern grain fed\nanimals have a high omega 6 to omega 3 ratio. If you eat the leanest cuts of\nmeat from commercially raised meat and suppliment with omega 3, you may\novercome that imbalance in commercial meat.\nI do suppliment with Krill oil, but I don't eat lean, or very lean meat.\nPaleo man is unlikely to have thrown away perfectly good animal fat, the way\nmodern man does.**\nbut if he didn't have it in the first place?\nOh, he did. Check out my post in the other thread on this with pictures of the\nfat on wild animals. Heck, paleo man ate hippopotamus - how many skinny hippos\nhave you seen?\nSo why is the book officially recommended by this site if it differs so\nradically from the main advice given here?\nThis site also recommends \"Life Without Bread\", \"Neanderthin\" and \"TBK\nFitness\".\nOur difference with Cordain mostly in the area of fat consumption, which is\naddresses in \"Life Without Bread\" and somewhat in \"Neanderthin\".\nI would also recommend \"Ignoring The Awkward\", \"Why We Get Fat\" by Gary\nTaubes, and \"Primal Blueprint\" by Mark Sisson.",

When fully charged, it has the second greatest overall arcane\nspirit shield having higher mage attack bonuses. Several shields have a higher\nPrayer bonus and Summoning defence bonus. When completely uncharged, its stats\nare somewhat better than a Defence level must be 75 or higher. This shield is\nalso unique for giving the highest strength bonus of any left-handed item. Its\nstrength bonus beats both the dragon defender by 1, allowing you to hit a\nlittle higher without having a two-handed sword equipped. skeletal wyverns can\ndrop the draconic visage. The shield itself was a possible drop from anti-\ndragon shield , only provides **partial** protection against dragonfire.\nUnlike the anti-dragon shield, it also provides skeletal wyverns. The\nDragonfire shield's ability to protect against dragon breath does Edit\nThe shield absorbs dragonbreath from all dragons, and even ice breath from\nSkeletal Wyverns, when equipped. Each dragonbreath, or ice breath, provides\none charge, up to a maximum number of 50 charges. Each charge increases the\nshield's defence against stab, slash, crush, range and summoning attacks by\n+1. The best place to charge a shield is anywhere with\nmetal dragons as when you move away from them they use their dragonbreath\nfaster than Chaos Tunnels are particularly good since they are in a\nmulticombat area; it is possible to have multiple Edit\nWhen the shield is worn, players can also release charges of dragonbreath by\noperating it.The Dragon Breath is so powerful it can hit things from 19 steps\naway (maximum). To discharge the flame, right-click on the equipped shield\nwhile in combat and select Activate. The shield will then fire a deadly blast\nof fiery energy at the opponent, which hits up to 300 damage, but lowers the\nstats of the shield by 1 for every charge used. Even if the shield is charged\nwith Ice breath from Skeletal Wyverns, only firebreath will be discharged,\nrather than the ice breath some might expect. Players can also operate the\nshield while not in combat and then target an opponent to release the attack\non. When fired, the attack will be long-ranged, and the player will run toward\nthe opponent to start fighting. The attack will not work against\nSkeletal Wyverns. Using the dragonbreath attack against a monster will earn\nMagic experience. The dragonbreath discharged is very, very accurate and is\ncommonly used as a sneak attack against an opponent. **Because of its great\naccuracy, it could determine the outcome of the battle if both parties are\nleft with less than 300 lifepoints. This strategy is commonly used in duel\narenas as well as pvp. Be careful of opponent having a dragonfire shield in a\nmatch.**\nThe damage of this attack is reduced just like a dragon's dragonbreath attack\nif the opponent is wearing an\nantifire potion. Once operated, the shield needs to cool down for exactly two\nminutes before the player can unleash its flames again. The only other piece\nof equipment to have this ability are dragon bolts (e) .\nSince the shield is untradeable when charged, it must be discharged completely\nbefore being sold; this can be done by right-clicking the shield in inventory\nand clicking the\n_empty_ option to release all remaining charges in a single, harmless burst.\nThe shield cannot be lent, whether it is charged or not. Edit Uncharged |\nFully charged\n---|---\nBonuses\nHover over image for type Edit\nWhen a dragon breathes fire on a player wearing the shield, the player crouches behind the shield and does not make an attacking motion, however, the damage against the dragon still registers.\n16 June 2009, players could get a dragonfire shield from PvP kills; however,\nthe aforementioned update removed dragonfire shields from PvP drop tables.\ndraconic visage weighs 1; however, when joined, the dragonfire shield's weight\nincreases to 7.2 kg.\nIn July 2010, the shield's appearance was updated so that both sides of the shield, the parts that were not covered by the visage, were orange. Previously, one side of the shield was orange, and the other side was the same colour as the visage.\nThe anti-dragon shield is held with the left hand when worn, however, when the draconic visage is attached to the anti-dragon shield, the dragonfire shield is attached to the forearm when equipped. It's possible that because of the shield's weight, the player has to get a better grip therefore holding it differently.\nDue to the shield's ability to protect you from Skeletal Wyverns' ice breath (much like the elemental, mind and body shields), this shield is the absolute best option for the off-hand slot when fighting this monster. The ice breath of wyverns can also be used to charge the dragonfire shield, just as dragonfire breath can.\nThe shield's special attack raises defence experience when used versus other players.\nAlthough the Anti-dragon shield has no magic attack penalty, the Dragonfire shield does.\nThe price of the Dragonfire shield is declining due to the release of the\nDragon defender . The Dragonfire shield has been less popular due to many\nplayers' preference to wield the Dragon defender instead.\nThe Dragon Defender's strength bonus is comparable to the Dragonfire shield - where an obsidian shield's +5 strength bonus is shadowed by the Dragonfire shield's +7. A\nDragon defender not only gives a considerable +6 strength bonus, it also\nboosts the best Attack bonuses for an item equipped in the shield slot, which\nmakes it a good replacement for the shield.",

India,\nPakistan and Israel have long argued that the agreement creates a \"club\" of\nnuclear powers.\n\"Regarding the export of uranium to India, the policy of the Australian\ngovernment is clear - we will only supply uranium to countries that are\nsignatories to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and have signed a\nbilateral agreement with Australia,\" energy minister Martin Ferguson said.\n\"This is not a policy specific to India, it applies equally to all countries,\"\nFerguson, who discussed with Krishna a range of energy sector issues, was\nquoted as saying by the Australian Associated Press.\nDuring the meeting, external affairs minister S.M.

When you are\ncarried away with your worries, fears, cravings, anger, and desire, you run\naway from yourself and you lose yourself. The practice is always to go back to\noneself.\"**\n\\- _Thich Nhat Hanh_\nSaying \"no\" is one of those things that no one likes to do. We're all busy,\noften too much so, and yet we are constantly bombarded by new opportunities.\nPeople ask for our help, for our time, for our attention every day. We all, as\ngood, compassionate human beings, dislike having to tell people \"no\" when they\nask us for help or for some other commitment. We want to help, but sometimes\nwe can't. How do you handle the act of disappointing someone else? How do you\nmake healthy decisions for yourself when every day offers chances to overfill\nyour schedule?\nWhat will you get from the commitment you're being asked to make? If the\nanswer is \"none,\" that's a good sign that you should say no. This applies to\npsychological value as well as physical or tangible value - will you enjoy the\ncommitment for itself? Will you enjoy it for the chance to help someone else?\nValue is about your whole experience, including, but not limited to, your\naltruistic enjoyment of helping someone else. If you won't get anything from\nthe project, not even the value of helping out, chances are it's not a good\nfit.\nBe realistic about your ability to add to the project or task you're being\nasked to perform.**\nThis goes hand in hand with considerations about value added for you. Think\nrealistically about how busy you are and whether or not you can really give\nthe new venture your full attention. Understand that if you are already fully\nor overly committed, you will not be able to offer the new project your best\nwork. In such a scenario, saying no is the most considerate thing, allowing\nthe asker to find someone who can give the project the attention it deserves.\nPrepare some tactful \"no\" responses.** Even once you have decided that\nsaying \"no\" is the right solution, the act of saying it can be difficult. To\nmake it easier, have some prepared responses that make it clear that your \"no\"\nis based on a consideration of what is best for the asker. Responses like \"I'm\nnot the best person for the job; maybe you should try ____\" or \"I'm currently\ntoo over-committed to be able to give your project the attention it deserves\"\nmake it clear that your denial is about valuing the other person, not about a\ndisinterest in their proposal.\nAt the end of the day, it all comes down to accepting that saying \"no\" is not\nrude, and is often the most courteous, considerate, and effective way to\nhandle a situation. The person asking for your help will appreciate your\nhonesty (definitely more than they'll appreciate you committing to something\nyou can't fully deliver on). Even if they're disappointed that you can't be a\npart of their proposal, they'll be more likely to think of you next time -\nthis kind of polite straightforwardness is all too rare in today's world and\nwill get people's attention.\n\\--------------------------------\nFeedback:**\nWhat are your ideas for effective, tactful ways to tell people \"no?\"",

        "text": "22 September 2010\nResearchers crack cuckoo egg mystery\n---\nResearchers at the University of Sheffield have discovered that cuckoo eggs\nare internally incubated by the female bird for up to 24 hours before birth,\nsolving for the first time the mystery as to how a cuckoo chick is able to\nhatch in advance of a host\u00b4s eggs and brutally evict them.**\nPublished today (22 September 2010) in the journal Proceedings of the Royal\nSociety of London, Series B, the research shows that internal incubation\nallows the cuckoo chick to hatch before its nest mates, evict them, and\nmonopolise the food brought by the foster parents.\nAlthough previous studies have suggested early hatching is achieved partly\nthrough the cuckoo producing a small egg which develops faster, it has long\nbeen suspected that there might be another reason for this.\nA team from Sheffield, headed up by Professor Tim Birkhead, from the\nUniversity\u00b4s Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, worked with cuckoo\nresearchers across Europe, to examine the newly laid eggs of eight cuckoos,\nand discovered that each one was at a more advanced stage than is normal among\nsmall birds. To test the idea that this advanced development was a result of\nthe female cuckoo retaining the egg inside her, they simulated `internal\nincubation\u00b4 in another species; the zebra finch.\nThe researchers took recently laid finch eggs and incubated them for 24 hours\nat body temperature, which is 40oC in both the finch and the cuckoo. After\nthis time, the zebra finch eggs were at the same stage as the cuckoo eggs at\nthe time they were laid.\nSuperficially this suggested that the internal incubation gives the cuckoo a\n24 hour head start over its host\u00b4s eggs, but the researchers discovered it is\nin fact more than this.\nWhen eggs are incubated by the adult birds in the nest, their eggs are at\nabout 36oC. Inside the female, the egg is at a body temperature of 40oC. This\ndifference in temperature means that 24 hours at 40oC gives the cuckoo egg a\n31 hour head start over the host eggs.\nMost birds release their ovum or the yolk of the egg from the ovary 24 hours\nbefore it is laid. Fertilisation occurs within 15 minutes of ovulation, and\nthe ovum then spends about 24 hours having the albumen, or egg white, and the\nshell put on to form a normal egg. This fully formed egg is laid 24 hours\nafter ovulation. Significantly, about six hours after the ovum is fertilised,\nthe microscopic embryo begins to develop and by the time the egg is laid, the\nembryo contains some 10,000 cells. It is only after two days of incubation\nthat there are any signs, visible to the naked eye, that the egg is developing\nand an embryo forming.\nIn the cuckoo however, the team demonstrated that the egg is ovulated and\nfertilised and then six hours later embryo development begins. As the egg\npasses down the oviduct, or egg tube, the white and shell are added, and once\nthe egg is fully formed, about 24 hours after it was released from the ovary,\nit then sits in the female\u00b4s oviduct for a further 24 hours. In other words,\nby the time the cuckoo egg is laid, it has had 18 to 24 hours of internal\nincubation at 40oC and hatches 31 hours ahead of any host egg laid at the same\ntime.\nProfessor Tim Birkhead, from the Department of Animal and Plant Sciences at\nthe University of Sheffield, said: \"The idea of internal incubation in birds\nhas until now been considered impossible because it was assumed that female\nbirds could not hold onto a fully formed egg. In fact, the idea of internal\nincubation by cuckoos was suggested as early as 1800, but then ignored. Our\nresults show that internal incubation gives cuckoo chicks that crucial head\nstart in life, allowing them to dispose of their nest mates - a superb\nadaptation to being a brood parasite.\"\nNotes for Editors:** Birkhead, T.

I think it's a sign that Israel is where I should be spending\nsome portion of my life, whether it be 1 month or 10 years. My guess it will\nprobably be closer to one month.\nThe flight service to Tel Aviv was fantastic. With a full row to myself I\nstretched out and caught some shut eye only to awaken to soft comfy blankets\nthat smelled like flowers. For those of you who do not live or spend much time\nin Europe, soft blankets are a serious luxury compared to the usual stiff,\nline-dried sand paper we use on a daily basis.\nA couple days in the sun with my mother and some healthy, natural, fresh food\nwas exactly what I needed to reset my body to pound the court for three more\nmonths before I travel back to Israel to renew my visa for a second time. I am\neven more excited for Mission Israel: renew visa round two because I may get\nto lay on the beach for a day in a bikini and most likely catch up on some\nmuch needed tanning time.\nI will leave you all with a collection of some very disjointed pictures I took\non our trip to Jerusalem. Such an incredible city with so much history. If you\never want to feel completely insignificant or an intense desire to figure out\nyour purpose, I suggest you take a little trip to Jerusalem.",

Oh, do ye ever stop to\nthink what that word means when ye use it every day, so lightly, o' yer wicked\nlives? No. Ye doan't. Ye never stop to think what anything means, do ye? Well,\nI'll tell ye. It means endless horrifyin' torment, with yer poor sinful bodies\nstretched out on hot gridirons in the nethermost fiery pit of hell, and demons\nmockin' ye while they waves cooling jellies in front of ye, and binds ye down\ntighter on yer dreadful bed. Aye, an' the air'll be full of the stench of\nburnt flesh and the screams of your nearest and dearest... Ye know, doan't ye,\nwhat it feels like when ye burn yer hand in takin' a cake out of the oven or\nwi' a match when ye're lightin' one of they godless cigarettes? Aye. It stings\nwi' a fearful pain, doan't it? And ye run away to clap a bit o' butter on it\nto take the pain away. Ah, but'\" (an impressive pause) \"there'll be no butter\nin hell! Yer whoal body will be burnin' and stingin' wi' that unbearable pain,\nand yer blackened tongues will be stickin' out of yer mouth, and yer cracked\nlips will try to scream out for a drop of water, but no sound woan't come\nbecause yer throat is drier nor the sandy desert and yer eyes will be beatin'\nlike great red-hot balls against yer shrivelled eyelids....\"**\n\"Any time something is written against me, I not only share the sentiment but\nfeel I could do the job far better myself. Perhaps I should advise would-be\nenemies to send me their grievances beforehand, with full assurance that they\nwill receive my every aid and support. I have even secretly longed to write,\nunder a pen name, a merciless tirade against myself.\"---",

The first day I brought my computer to work, I\nforgot the USB cable. Nice. So today I grabbed the whole box from when I\nbought my camera, which should contain the USB cable. It was especially slow\nat work today, so I took out the box to go over the manual and add my pixs. I\nopen the box, no USB! I know it was there when I bought it and I am now\nremembering that it is attached to my adapter that I use to charge the\nbattery! Really? So, I think, \"Okay, I'll just put my memory card into my\nprinter at work and get them that way.\" I put the memory card in the printer\nand get an error message saying \"memory card error\".

And because PEP also tracks each individual\u00b4s training\npath, it becomes easier for healthcare staff to monitor their progress as they\nwork towards achieving required knowledge proficiency requirements and\nensuring they remain current and compliant.\nAt a time when clinical laboratory managers face staffing shortages, cost\nconstraints, and greater workloads - all while helping healthcare providers\ndeliver quality patient care - the value of education becomes increasingly\nimportant. PEP helps address many of these challenges with an innovative\napproach to professional healthcare education. This includes a new standard\nfor competency-based education, administrative and tracking support for all\nparticipants, along with the ability to mold the curriculum to support various\nlearning needs.\n\"Over the past four decades, the clinical laboratory diagnostics market has\nrelied heavily upon a 'train-the-trainer\u00b4 approach for laboratorians to\nachieve mastery of sophisticated instrumentation, which can be inefficient and\nexpensive,\" said Chris Christopher, Vice President, Global Customer Solutions,\nSiemens Healthcare Diagnostics. \"By leveraging today\u00b4s IT and advanced\nlearning management systems, we developed Personalized Education Plan-a highly\ninnovative, competency-based learning approach that will dramatically change\nthe way our industry conducts training.\"\nPEP offers customized laboratory education that blends interactive training\nwith hands-on practice and assessment to reinforce and internalize learning.\nOnline education is available anytime, anywhere, and is accessible and\nconvenient for all shifts and staff levels. The curricula are standardized and\nevergreen, ensuring all staff receive consistent education regardless of\nshift, location or tenure with the company.\n\"PEP will be a huge advantage to the laboratory because it will bring together\nall the educational aspects that have always been available offsite and\nonline,\" says Marilyn Leonard, Chemistry Supervisor, White Plains Hospital,\nWhite Plains, NY. \"It\u00b4ll allow me to continually assess and guarantee that\neverybody in the lab, 24/7, all the different shifts and staff levels-whether\nfull, part time or per diem employees-have the same level of competency.\"\nBeyond a dynamic menu of online product training, PEP also offers education on\ngeneral laboratory topics and disease-state management. PEP consists of three\ncomponents:\nMy Planner:** Allows user and supervisor to design a Personal Education Plan\nby selecting competency courses that support the specific job role.\nMy Curriculum:** Launches the user\u00b4s personal virtual workbook that contains\nall the educational activities contained in the Planner. The user selects the\nlearning activities and completes them when and where it is convenient.\nMy Transcript:** The learner can track the progress and completion of all\nonline learning and hands-on activities as well as Continuing Education (CE)\ncredits earned.\nThe Personalized Education Plan is available exclusively to Siemens Healthcare\nDiagnostics customers as part of the company\u00b4s Customer Care portfolio, which\nincludes services and support, education and training, and workflow\nmanagement. PEP is currently available in English and will soon be available\nin multiple languages.\n\"Siemens has a long history of offering a blended approach to customer\ntraining through access to our training centers, onsite education, regional\nevents, and technology-based education systems, which support training at a\ndistance,\" said Christopher. \"With our Personalized Education Plan, we are\ntaking our educational support tools to the next level.\" Colin Booth to Speak\nat European Diagnostic Performance Evaluation & Regulatory Conference Lugol's\nSolution for Gram Stain - Standard and with PVP Stabilised Solution Lab M\nKicks off 2011 Conference Programme at SfAM Winter Meeting Strengthening\nEfforts to Reduce Salmonella - in the Poultry Production Chain Cherwell\nConfirms Autoclave Validation Applications using DataTrace\u00ae",

        "text": "As I sort through my papers and file them away, I wonder what Gerard is doing.\nA bright, sunny Saturday.\nHe told me that he was on a Geography field trip. Reminds me of the school\ntrips that I had when I was younger. I love field trips. I love the excitement\nof seeing something outside school, going with friends, laughing and having\nfun. I love exploring, wondering how everything came to be, wondering the\ndesigner's intentions, what he or she was trying to convey.\nBut I digress.\nI miss Gerard so much. So few words, so much weight behind them. Sometimes\ntrying to explain how you feel just does not cut it. No words can explain what\nI really feel.\nI do wish I did not agree to come over. And yet, I feel thankful that I am\nhere. That I am a part of a while new experience, that I am growing, that I am\nlearning so so much more. After all, one is unable to feel happiness without\nfeeling pain and loss. If we had everything we wanted, how would we grow, how\nwould we learn?\nEverything is still new and exciting to me. Yes, despite being here for almost\ntwo months, I am still adapting and adjusting.\nPeople are more open and outspoken. The culture and style of customer service\nis exciting. Service staff will always approach you, seem very happy to serve\nyou, and appear to genuinely not mind if you do not purchase anything. I have\nseen the forced smiles that I received back home when I walk away from\npurchasing something. The glares that pursue me make me feel bad and ashamed\nfor not purchasing anything, for wasting the salesperson's time and effort.\nHowever, I have also received some bad service here too, though they are few\nand far between.\nI am learning to chat with salespeople. A yawn from a cashier made me enquire\nif she had had a long day. I learnt that she had been was working a 12 hour\nshift. We wished each other a good weekend and I exited with my purchase.\nI love the informality that the lecturers and tutors have with us. They ask us\nto call them by their first names and always encourage us to approach them if\nwe need help. One of my tutor usually sits and have a chat with Fergus and I\nbefore he goes for his next lesson. We talk about the weirdest issues. Haha.\nMaking friends with students from other countries is also great fun. We learn\nabout each other's cultures and extend invitations to visit our country,\npromising to bring the visitor around. Such fun!\nIt is also great fun to speak in different languages, knowing that the\nmajority will not be able to understand. When I speak in Chinese, my aim is to\nprevent the English-speaking majority from understanding, but the majority of\nAsians would understand. Switching to a dialect with a mix of Singlish would\neffectively eliminate almost everyone from understanding save for any\nSingaporeans. Perfect! Haha. I so have to brush up on my dialect as well as\nunderstand Cantonese. Bother.\nBeing here opens my eyes to a whole new world of opportunities and makes me\nrealise that there is SO MUCH MORE that I can do and experience. The future is\nnot as straight-forward as I had planned it to be. Time to open more avenues\nand paths. I shall journey forward to the great unknown, but I know that I\nwill not be alone.\nMissing everyone so much.",
