I just wanted to reflect on the goings-on of my summer, due to the fact that I don't get out much so I am a poor person to have a conversation with so, here we go: 1. I was honored to recieve a nomination for Who's Who in American High School Students. 2. I participated in a downtown play at La Petit Theatre De Terrebonne (orchestra was the Shizznit!) 3. I had the pleasure (yeah, right.) of being a drill seargent in our band camp at Terrebonne High. 4. I assisted my sister in being published in the International Society of Poets' newest volume of poetry, Tracing the Infinite , which she won a plaque for most outstanding poet 13 and older. 5. Of course, I have to talk about LBA , one of the greatest congregations of musicians I have ever had the pleasure of attending. And thats about it. As you can see, my life is filled to the brim with social activities, which I would like to thank a few people for showing to me: Kate and Brett , thank you for being such intelligent people and . . . well . . .just being all around cool people; I really appreciate you guys emmensely.

        "text": "Whoa...it's something that the people don't really expect that things can happen by itself. I am not really scared of that because I am really getting used to it 5-6 times before. Here what happened. When I was on the way to the city where I was supposed to help by work cleaning the house with someone, until something went over my head and things did happened really unexpectedly to me. When I drove through the freeway and about to changed the lane to other after checked on my side of pickup. Suddenly, I noticed that the truck in front of me was stopped very soon and I cannot expect it to do that and stomped on the brake but it's too late for that. My pickup's front left corner already smashed on the truck's back right corner. The other truck have lil damage but mine was worst. I saw the smoke came out and the antifreeze liquid leaked all over the road. I was like frozen and said \"damn...\" in my mind. My mouth exhaled and inhales outside and inside slowly. You know the route for the car wreck like reporting the police department, write down on other person's driver liscense and car insurance, signed on the wreck report paper down, and so on the list. The state trooper gave me the ticket for getting close to the vehicle that worth $171. Big ouch for me. Later, the state trooper (st) and me had a chat while we were on the way to drop me off because my dad can picked me up. Here what happened is: We chatted by wrote on the paper back and forth. Me and State trooper talked about new police radar that have video camera, police speed radar, etc until the special conversation came up. ST: How old are you? Me: 24 ST: Do you work? Me: No, I have been looking for a job since I graduated from university because the jobs are getting harder and harder to find these days. The state trooper nodded in agreement. ST: Do you ever had a ticket before? Me: Honestly, yes. But I hadn't had one for long time until now because I had been drove very carefully. He nodded again. Me: But sometime things can happens unexpectedly to anyone. He went hmm and wrote down on the paper ST: Give me the ticket I went look for it and gave it to him then I was puzzled about that and read what he said to me without write down on the paper. He said \"Don't worry about that and I will take care of that.\" I was shocked and surprised then write down on the paper Me: Thank you very much and I am very appreciate with that. I did shook the hand with him and thanked him. See what I mean? I am very lucky enough to getting out of the $171-worth ticket for being honest with the state trooper and did learned the big valuable lesson for telling nothing but truth to the state troopers. Sometime the unlucky situation can lead to the lucky day. That's all I have the news for now.",

Since my surgery, Stan has really been doing a fantastic job at keeping the lawn looking it's best. We even had help from our friend, Karen Landis. She came over last Weekend and helped Stan pull weeds in the front yard. Thanks again, Karen. With the temp. Starting to reach 100 deg. I doubt I will be able to get Stan to do his chores in the yard! I will post some pictures of the flowers in the field across the street. The festival has begun and the fields are getting full of people from all around the state. It's so pretty looking out the front window and seeing our view. We really take it for granted. If we go for a walk through the dahlias tonight, I will take the camera and post some close up pictures of the flowers so you all can enjoy them to. During the Dahlia Festival, please feel free to come by and walk the fields and visit. It's really a great time of year out here and we love to have people stop by for a visit! Don't be shy, just call and let us know you will be out this way and we will let you know if we will be home. Well, I need to get up and do something, so, I will write more later. Right now I need to go and lay in the sun. (Hey, the doctor told me to take it easy for six weeks, so, I might as well have a good tan!!!!)",

        "text": "Since I am busy, I don't have time to write a blog today...right now. SO, I thought that I would post one of my assignments from my final undergrad class, which I finish this week. So here you go: Throughout the entire bible, fire is used as a symbol for many things, but mainly as a symbol of judgment. How appropriate and predictable then is the use of fire in the Book of Revelation. However, before we delve into the book in question, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s set up this use of fire from previous examples in the bible. Throughout my readings in this class, I have encountered the use of fire. Luckily for me, many intelligent men and women have invented biblical concordances. In the Torah, fire is the main way in which God manifests himself on earth. Some examples being the covenant with Abraham (Gen. 15:17), the burning bush (Ex. 3:2-4), the pillar of fire (Ex. 13:21), and on Mt. Sinai (Ex.19:18). From the very beginning then, the authors of the bible have set up fire as a symbol of God himself. Fire is also used during many sacrifices, either as the way in which the sacrifice is offered (Ex. 12:8,9,10; Lev. 1), or as the way that Yahweh accepts the offering (1 Kin. 18:38; 1 Chr. 21:26). Incense, also present in the Book of Revelation, is another way in which fire manifests itself in the bible. Incense\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main use is in burning to fragrance the air. This, obviously, involves fire. In the Book of Revelation, fires main use is to be symbolic of the power of the Son of Man. The first mention of this is when the prophet/author John turns to hear the voice of the one who is delivering the message to him. In Revelation 1:14, John says \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I love the vision that this creates! These pure features of white set-off by burning eyes of fire. This vision is reiterated to the people of Thyatira in the Son of Man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s address to them (2:18). The only other mention of fire in His seven addresses is in the message to the people of Laodicea (3:18). He encourages them to by their gold from him: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich.\u00e2\u0080\u009d What I believe the Son of Man is trying to say here is that the gold (life) that I can give you is far stronger than the gold (wealth) that you seek on earth. The next six references to fire are all in reference to the same topic: The Seven Spirits (or Angels) of God (4:5; 8:4,7,8,9; 9:17). These are the angels that carry out all of the apocalyptic judgments upon the earth. At first, they are described as \u00e2\u0080\u009cseven lamps of fire burning before the throne\u00e2\u0080\u009d (4:5). Later on, in Revelation 5, these are the same Spirits which are said to be the eyes of the Lamb; the Lamb being the only thing in existence which can open the scroll held by \u00e2\u0080\u009chim that sat on the throne.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This draws us back to the first reference in Revelations, making me believe that the flames in his eyes were the Spirits all along. The next mention of fire is definitely my favorite. When describing the two witnesses that will proclaim the word of God to the people, it is said that \u00e2\u0080\u009cif any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies (11:5). It may be the pyromaniac adolescent male in me, but this image personifies the power of God to me. He can give two men the ability to smote enemies of His word. The next couple of references use fire in the description of The Beast and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions. Although fire is not directly mentioned, using the image of a red dragon to be The Beast makes one automatically think of fire-breathing (12:3). Also, as a sign of his power, The Beast calls fire from the sky (13:3). Once again, the Angels of Judgment are the ones who use fire repeatedly. When pouring out the bowl judgments, the Spirits us fire to punish those with the mark of the Beast (14:10) and the Angel who controls the fire gives orders to the ones with scythes to harvest the earth (14:18). Finally, the image of fire returns again to this majestic white figure with flaming eyes (19:12). Over the final 3 chapters, this Rider uses fire and the Lake of Fire to punish the non-believers (those not in the book of life), the Beast and his false prophet, and finally, the devil himself. To me, the Book of Revelation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of fire is symbolic of God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to judge and judge fairly. Those who do believe in him are spared the burning of their flesh (16:8) among other things. In the eyes of the Rider, the fire is at home as the instruments with which Jesus Christ, the Son of Man, can judge his people in his Kingdom on earth.",

        "text": "Most books on Capricorns say that Capricorns are serious, tedious workaholics who climb steadily and surely up the mountain to their goals. I scoffed every astrology book that claims that about Capricorns.\nI'm a Capricorn, and all my life, I had never been a steady and sure mountain-climber. I was a lazy bum without any goals that lasted five months. To my point of view, I was as far as possible from the traditional Capricorn.\nThen I read a book that said a little more about Capricorns. Sure, Capricorns climb up mountains, surely and steadily, but only when they have found their goal. Most young Capricorns, who have yet to find their goals and dreams, tend to be listless, lazy bums that turn workaholic overnight when they have objectives in sight.\nThe book also said that there were actually two types of Capricorns. The positive side of the coin are the mountain goats who climb up to achieve their dreams, steadily and surely. The negative side of the coin are nanny and billy goats who are pegged to the ground, going round and round and round, never actually getting anywhere.\nFor years, I've been the nanny goat. I've been running round and round without a goal I believe in, without a dream I want down to my bones. Then I found my goals and dreams, but I was still running around as a nanny goat, because I didn't know how to get rid of the tether that held me back. My negative self-image, my ignorance, and my arrogance were ropes that tied me to my peg so tightly, I couldn't even see the way out.\nNow I feel like I'm a nanny goat who has just learnt to untie a few of those ropes that pegged me down. I can feel my opportunity to turn into a mountain goat nearing. Maybe I'm even now at the bottom of my mountain, and I've already taken the first few steps towards my dreams.\nI feel excited and full of hope. I must remember however, not to fall into despair if I fall. Only the mountain matters. I must climb it, no matter how often I fall. That's the secret to being a mountain goat.\nIt's not that mountain goats don't fall. It's that they refuse to stop climbing the mountain no matter how difficult or scary it gets. I can smell the fresh air now. I can smell the freedom of being on the mountain.\nI refuse to return to the limitations of being a nanny goat, no matter how safe and comforting it feels. In the end, nanny goats get slaughtered, while mountain goats roam free.",

Anyway, it was the boyfriend who pointed me to The Political Compass and had me finally committing to a position through the quiz provided by that website.\nOther than the specific topic of education, I normally hate thinking or discussing politics. As a kid, I watched and listened to my parents and their friends discuss Malaysian politics. I listened to my grandparents' stories of the upheaval they went through, in the times of the Japanese occupation and communist threats. I haven't stopped listening. I haven't stopped watching.\nI've spent so much time listening and watching that I never voiced my own political opinions or sought out my own political experiences. Truthfully, I have other priorities. After all, if you want to change the world, you have to start with yourself; I'll be the first to admit that my self needs a lot of work.\nSo here's the results from The Political Compass :\nEconomic Left/Right: -0.88\nSocial Libertarian/Authoritarian: -4.05\nThat means I'm a Libertarian with a slight left leaning.\nIn actual terms, my political beliefs are similar to my beliefs on raising children. When a baby is trying to walk, I'll just make sure all fatal things are out of the way, and let the baby stumble and totter around as much as it likes. And really, that's what I'd like my government to do. Make sure the environment is safe enough for all of us to make fools of ourselves to our hearts' content. Comparing the government to a parent, I want the government to also provide good education.\nAlas, at the moment, Malaysia doesn't provide safety nor education that is good enough to satisfy me. But as I said before, I'm too busy worrying about me right now, to give a shit about the world at large. So here's my rare political voice, shutting up now .",

        "text": "By FRANCES D'EMILIO, Associated Press Writer ROME - The three-month offer of a terrorism truce \u00e2\u0080\u0094 made in April purportedly by Osama bin Laden (news - web sites) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 expired on Thursday, little noticed in European countries that had been invited to accept it. At the time the taped message was broadcast on Islamic satellite networks April 15, CIA (news - web sites) officials said that technical analysis of the recording indicated it was probably authentic. \"I announce a truce with the European countries that do not attack Muslim countries,\" said the audiotape by a man identifying himself as bin Laden. \"The door to a truce is open for three months,\" but the time frame could be extended. \"The truce will begin when the last soldier leaves our countries,\" the speaker said without elaborating. An apparent attempt to drive a wedge between Europe and America, it was quickly spurned by Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain. -- Doesn't anyone read anymore??? In the Islamic faith, there is no such thing as a truce. The closest thing to it is called \"Hudna\" . A hudna is a cease to hostilites during a battle for the sheer purpose to resupply and gear up for round 2. They have no intentions of surrender or negotiations. You can't negotiate with these animals. They only understand one thing...and that is power. If you destroy them...they lose. If you give in...they win. it is as simple as that. It really is.

Ok, so p4s got to bake cookies to sell, and p5s are bday party planners.. But I was embarrassed during one of the p5's lesson, Why? Coz I told them that we will compile the results with the results of the cookies.. And the best ting is, one of the girls said :\"But Teacher.. We are not baking cookies...\" Then i realised that i said someting wrong, DAMN MALU sia! And the manager from my company was sitting behind observing everything.. GONE! But he seemed like a nice guy, hope he didnt mind, LOL! Oh well, in the mid of the lesson, a cockroach came out, and the kids were running around, lol. The form teacher, who is a lady, seems scared at that time, but she took out a tissue and tried to catch it, LOL. But b4 she can reach the cockroach, xiao qiang ran away to my side and im already armed with two tissue papers, so i caught it easily. I practically crushed the tissue paper in my hands and the kids said :\"Teacher, dont crush it can? So cruel..\" WTF, theres SPCA I know, but now theres SPCP (S'pore Prevention Towards Cruelty to Pests) ? Whats with this sudden love towards pests nowadays? A few weeks ago, i caught a lizard in my room and i threw it away, and my fren said :\"Aiyo, why kill it?\".. I still rem that a long time ago, people always smack pests with slippers, newspapers, etc. And now? Crushing a cockroach/lizard in a tissue paper is cruel, so is smacking a mosquito on ur arm cruel? Mosquito is also a pest rite? Ermz... someone enlighten me please? Ok, seems like a lot of ppl commented on me typing my current underwear in my blog, Im sure some ppl are interested to know rite?

I am really kinda pissed off at this lady who came to our school and pissed us all off..... I don't know what to do to get it off my mind. This lady basicly came in here and told us that we were racist and that we were wrong and that we needed to change... .... Thats not the whole point she was trying to make. She was saying that things sway in our favor meaning I am white. But somethings tend not sway in other people of other races favor and thats whats wrng. She could have just said that, but she went on this whole speech about how things used to be and the way things are in other places. But maybe this place isn't like other places. Maybe we are diffrent. Maybe we aren't, who the hell knows. In class for the first half of it that was all we were talking about. I am done talking about it. I am not racist I know people who are and thats just fine for them I am not associated with them. Some of them I do hang out with and I don't hate them or dispise them for that at all i except that as their opinion and thats that. nothing more nothing less........ ......... I wish people would stop looking at the technicalities of the situation and take what she has to say as something that we can learn from and maybe even change if thats wha this generation wants to do? I want the world to change but I don't look at it as a realistic option for us or any human in gerneral. I am not saying that all of these people who try to change the world for the better aren't they are changing it only a minority of it changes. That is personally not enough change to see the world as a better place then before. I am just so worked up about this I don't know what to do with myself. I think that I just want to break down and cry and I don't want to at the same time cuz I think that I would never stop crying and that would just be mean. I think that people need to be more accepting to others opinions. In class I walked out I couldn't take it and I shouldn't have to. I swear if we have another disscusion on it in D-Block I am so going to cry and no one can stop me not even me for that matter.",

When they showed the slideshow of all the outgoing seniors, it was really, um, emotional for some, because it's not like they were guys we only knew for one year, but these dudes had been with us throughout our whole CC career. But it was still cool, and we had pretty good Senior Gifts. It was all my idea of course, becuase all of the other slacker juniors were like, \"Duuhhhh....we'll see if we can think of something before WE graduate...\" But anyway, We got the guys boxes of Wheaties with their pictures on it and a thank-you note thingy on the back thanking them for their dedication, help, inspiration, etc. They really liked it, especially the two guys who have semi- 'fros that we found pics of cool runners with 'fros to transpose their heads onto. Yeah. Everyone went to Heather Hartzog's house afterward. Daaannnggg, that girl is rich! Her house was humong-diddley-mongous, and it had a cool secret room that had a stereo and foosball table....Oh, it was awesome. And Julie got to go the the banquet and Heather's and she really enjoyed herself. She makes good chocolate chip brownies... But while we're on the topic; Julie, I'm so sorry, but Melissa's brownies are better. I know she whipped them up a la Betty Crocker, but I just like chocolate more than choc. chip. Marylin, however, still makes the best pie.... you guys know what I'm talking about. Mrs. Kelley is smelly. I've heard this from those who have to sit in front of her when she's at her \"second desk\" and she breathes nasty hot air down the back of their necks. Just imagine the sound of a squirrel suffocating in a plastic bag, and that's what it sounds like when Mrs. Kelley breathes. And her breath reeks like yesterday's gym socks. Wait a minute- nobody goes to \"gym\" anymore. It's all a bunch of namby-pamby athletic things like football, or dance, or that joke of jokes that counts as an athletic credit, Bearkadettes. You haven't tried something easy till you've tried Bearkadettes. All they have to do is get out there after hours and hours and hours of practice and perform in front of people who expect the very best all the time and once they dance and kick and ssttttrreeetttccchhh their lil hearts out, return to a moronic instructor who tells them, \"Smith! Mcellin! Markowski! Your chins were not high enough, and I did NOT see enough smile from you. Morgan! I don't know what you're laughing about, but your jazz fingers were excessively annoying! I never want to be associated with any of you again!\" IN case any of oyu couldn't tell so, (Melissa) I was joking about Bearkadettes being easy. From what I've heard, it's really hard. But not as hard as cross-country. Thats is a real man's sport. As we say, \"Our sport is your sport's punishment.\" But anyway.... I'm going to Austin for the weekend in about 10-20 minutes, so I will have to go get ready. I'm going to visit my friend Bert, who was my best friend from elementary school. Some of you may remember him; most never knew him. He's a cool guy, believe me. Oh, but he is nothing compared to Bobby Creighton. That guy is the King of Cool, lemme tell ya. NOT. I have never met a more gay, stupid, idiotic, gay, wants-to-be-Negro, moronic, gay \"dude\" in all my life! Those of you that know him, holla back. You know exactly what I'm talking about. Sorry this hasn't been a great blog, but I've been rushed. I hoped you enjoyed it anyway, and I will try and update it as soon as I get back from my trip. Have a good weekend, chickee babies! (What was I thinking when I wrote that last statement? Chickee babies? I mean, really....I'm not high or anything, so I don't know what came over me...) Anyway, party on. God bless.",

Which makes me a little bit happy because once the ick went away, I got to see my friends and we've been having a lot of fun. You'd be amazed at the kinds of hijinx we can get into in this little corner of the world. Tonight, I witnessed a group of 10 or more grown men jump into a lake fully clothed just because they all dared each other to do it. I don't anyone of them actually expected any of them to do it, but, dude, a dare is a dare. They seemed completely unphased by the fact that it was not even 35 degrees outside. This was, of course, after the football games of the day. Holy shit, was it a good day in the world of football. Okay, so Iowa State lost. Again. To Kansas. But, other than that, it was spectacular. Iowa won and virtually assured themselves a New Year's Day bowl. Michigan won, but more importantly, Ohio State lost to Michigan, thereby throwing their ass out in the cold as far as the national championship game goes. No way in hell did OSU deserve to be there this season. Last season it was debatable. Yeah, they won last year, but they didn't even win the Big Ten outright, how do they then have the right to say they're the best team in the land? They don't. Because I said so. You know what. If I didn't adore JM so very much, I'd be about tired of seeing this special on MTV. This is the fourth or fifth time I've seen it in the last two or three weeks. It's good, don't get me wrong, but I could put the thing on mute and give you the entire show. Verbatim. To be completely honest, I also have it on tape. Because I'm obsessed. It's a sickness. BUT, in my defense, I taped it because I wasn't sure when it re-aired and I wanted to see it. I had no prior knowledge of this insomnia bullshit that has been plaguing me. AND, I now know that it's actually better than this big over-hyped performance on Austin City Limits. I know this because while I was still awake last night, I watched that (because it finally aired here). Now, I'm not saying ACL was bad, I'm just saying that it wasn't quite what I'd pictured with all the hype surrounding it. Buddy Guy was phenomenal. The few songs they aired were great. But it left me unsatisfied. Kind of like when you just eat one potato chip--because we all know you can't eat just one. There needed to be more; the show needed to be longer. Okay, in my quest to sound like the biggest hypochondriac on the planet, I have to say that something is wrong with my arm. Something bit me or stung me or something right near the elbow-pit and it itches and kind of stings like a mo-fo and its driving me a little bit crazy. You can only scratch for so long. If I could find my bag o' wonders with all the weird little medical items that I rarely/never use, I'd be able to put some goop on it to make it stop itching. But, I can't find it. What's up with me not being able to find shit around here? Seriously. My place isn't that big (well, it's bigger than most, but not that big), and there isn't a ton of storage, so how do you misplace a queen size comforter bag full of first aid type crap? I just don't understand. I've looked in boxes (yes, I still have boxes in my apartment from when I moved here more than a year and a half ago), I've looked under my bed, I've looked in drawers, I've looked in storage containers, I've looked in the medicine cabinet (I know), I've looked in the backseat of my car. I've looked EVERYWHERE! No bag. Now, I know the bag is here, because I've used items from it since I moved in. But I've looked everywhere for it to no avail. In other news (there's always other news--we should just accept that as a fact of life), the heat that some days I believe is fixed is now not fixed and it's really fucking hot in here. On the eve of the first winter storm to rumble through here, I should not be sitting here with a tank top and shorts on while sweating and watching the temperature guage on the thermostat continue to creep up. My guests are all sleeping sans-blankets (I'm still not clear on why they're sleeping on my floor instead of on the nice soft comfy beds at the already-paid-for Ramada, but whatever). Someone remind me that I HAVE to get groceries tomorrow. Because 24 hours more without coffee and I'm probably going to kill someone. Well, that and I just finished up all the pasta in the house, and in this house, that's a disaster--especially now that it looks like I'll be making the race-eve pasta dinner for all the people that don't actually need the pasta (coaches are so needy sometimes). Oh, and because I honestly have absolutely no edible items in the house. I have a container of sweet and sour sauce, ketchup, a clove of garlic and three gallon jugs of water in the fridge--and that's all. The freezer has bags of ice in it and some Arm & Hammer. The cabinets have a lot of spices, olive oil, sugar, some paper plates, and a container of Country Time Pink Lemonade. Yes, I am going to have to go to the store tomorrow, no matter what. I can't even make excuses. I really hate grocery shopping. I hate it even more on weekends. And even more than that when I know there are thousands of extra people wandering around because of this NCAA meet on Monday (let's just say it's not terribly common to see a group of girls wandering around wearing Carolina blue track suits--hell, it's not even common to see a group of anybody wandering around wearing panther purple track suits, because we never did and they still don't). And I know where all of those people will be. They'll be clogging up the aisles of SuperTarget. And that? Will not make me happy. What did make me happy? Getting to get an early look at the NCAA course and give it a good run-through before anyone else. That kicked all sorts of ass. And the course will, too. Especially when it gets nice and muddy (which it will because of the spectacular weather we'll be offering these nice kids from out of town--24 degrees with lots of wind and some possible snow, after a solid three days of rain). Nice and goopy. My early predictions for the winners (based solely on who everyone else is picking, because I haven't paid any attention to any runners not on the team here this season): Flanagan and Ritzenhein will win. Shit, from what I hear, Ritz loves running in the shitty conditions. The shittier, the better. He wouldn't let this course beat him (it's not a difficult course--at least not when it's dry). And Flanagan is, well, she was good last time I saw her run a few years ago, so I assume that hasn't changed. Well, that and the consensus of the sleeping people in the room tell me that's who will win. Okay, there's a Figi's catalogue tormenting me. I need to go look at that and listen to my stomach growl because it's not being fed any yummy chocolate. 3:10 am",

You know what bugs me? No? Yes? Well, what bugs me (aside from the word, \"bugs,\") is parentheses. I use them all the time, but I don't know how to use them correctly. Grr, pooey. It's like the tootsie roll thing, except instead of, \"The world may never know,\" it's more like, \"Catie may never know because she's an idiot.\" OK...this will probably be a pretty abrupt change in subjects but someone just called me, and I completely forgot what I was writing about, and I don't want to take the effort to get back into the train of thought I was in before. Steve just called about chem stuff. He's such a cool kid, I love him. In a friend kind of way of course. :) He's also got the coolest hair. Chemistry...ah, I dislike it with a deep burning passon that eats away at the soul. No...not really, but..it is rather obnoxious. Well..we had the whole evening with humanities thing kast night. Yikes. It was...not great, lets just put it that way, and never bring it up again. Hmmm, this is odd. I have no homework for once, and I had a free afternoon. No jazz all week. This is both good and bad. I love jazz, and yet...it's nice to have free time. I wonder if anyone's noticed how completely random everything I've written on here is. Heh. More fun! You all know me...spontanious Catie. RAR! Ah, guess what? Guess...come on...I bet you aren't guessing...GUESS!!! Alright sorry, I'll just tell you. I went on high ropes yesterday, and made it across the swinging balance beam with Peter. Of course, Mr. Z finds something wrong in EVERYTHING we do, so...Peter and I didn't do it correctly. Evil. Hmmm...possibly I should go warm up for my trumpet lesson. Yes? No? Ah, that's super fun to say. I'm having so much fun writing random stuff thought. Oh well, more later maybe.

        "text": "Entering New Markets Internationally Market entry decisions are among the most important strategic choices companies make. Entering any market requires a major commitment of financial and managerial resources, but foreign markets can be especially demanding. The recent issue of the SternBusiness carries an article on a discussion of strategies for enterning new markets globally. It says that the majority research on the internationalization process focuses on two factors as the primary determinants of foreign market entry: cultural similarity and economic attractiveness. Many researchers find that cultural similarity with respect to the domestic market is an important determinant of entry, while others have found that market entry decisions are positively related to country size and the levels of development, trade, and infrastructure. Higher near-market economic knowledge is associated with higher probability of entry. By investing in a small country first and learning about the cultural and economic characteristics of its consumers and business institutions, a firm may be more successful when entering a larger country with similar characteristics. The article explores the prevailing assumptions regarding the entry of an MNC into a new market, and then further goes on to analyse the most common product domains which have been a success in entering new markets. An interesting article, and the inferences drawn from the study henceforth.",

Amar Bhide discusses his book here and also pops out some nitty gritties of starting up your own business. An interesting read and a must for any budding entrepreneur. The introduction to the interview is catchy itself. Check it out: \"I can't even begin to calculate how often people who are thinking about starting new businesses have asked me to name the one book that illuminates, more than any other, what it's essential to understand in order to create a successful start-up. For close to 20 years now, I've had to answer that there is no such animal. Don't get me wrong -- there are lots of perfectly acceptable books about almost every imaginable aspect of starting and running a new venture, from writing a business plan to raising capital. The limitation of such books is that, important though those tasks may be, you can get them right and still fall flat on your entrepreneurial face.\"",

        "text": "SINGLE WHITE WEST WINGNUT For the first time in a few months, I picked up Entertainment Weekly this morning - it figures, since I was supposed to be reading about India's economic development. But that's by the wayside. Sadly, the magazine tells me that the incomporable Elvis Costello has split from his lovely wife Cait O'Riorden , former bassist for the Pogues . I think I might have actually felt unnaturally sad at this news, and why? I've been an Elvis fan for years, but this doesn't mean he's retiring. I suppose I just feel a little pull whenever anything bad happens to someone who's been affiliated with a band once known as the Nipple Erectors. I see also that The West Wing is listed among \"What Blew\" in EW's ratings review for NBC . Trying to explain the ratings slip among 18-49ers, NBC Entertainment president Jeff Zucker said, \"Clearly the young women were taken away by 'The Bachelor'.\" Ugh. You know, I saw that show once. My God is all I have to say. I watch The West Wing, and if there really is a contingent of female viewers who watch both shows, they must watch WW solely to drool over the forgettable Rob Lowe - with the sound off. Anyway, no harm, no foul, because Lowe will soon be replaced by Joshua Malina , the kind of man I really drool over.",

        "text": "Ten point five gets a three That NBC monstrosity, 10.5, is beginning it's second night of torturing America right now, and I thought I'd go ahead and share my thoughts before my mind is too numb to type. It's a bad attempt at a \"24\" style action drama. Diamond said it best.. it's way too formulaic - too predictable, and too patterned. Heroine scientist lady knows exactly what's going on, but since no technology exists to measure deep enough to see what's going on, no one except a good friend at work believes her, and because they ignore her, San Fransisco residents get pummeled. There's your predictable at odds father and daughter out for some special time together to try and mend their troubled relationship, and they get cut off from wife/mom who just happens to be the governor of California. Then of course there is the troubled family, dad is a doctor, and in this feminist wad of fetid tripe, he is of course irresponsible, disregarding the wants and needs of his wife and two kids to go and buy himself a new car, but despite their troubles, they are separated by the quake and only communicate by phone. Yes, this movie is a feminist wad of rotting cow intestine.. the hero ine scientist, the female governor of California, the responsible parent is always the woman.. with as blatently over the top as this movie is with everything else, they didn't do a very good job of muffling the feminazi overtones in the writing, either. The emphasis which the actors use in their lines is the same as \"24\", the camera zooms and multi-window simultaneous events are the same.. it even has the \"at first skeptical, but now convinced\" mean boss (who happens to be male) who disbelieved scientist chick and is now on site with an Armageddon-style drill through the rock and plant a nuke scheme. Hey, NBC, do yourself a favor and look up \"original\" in the dictionary, and apply it to your next movie miniseries, eh?",

I come to a shocking but a tragic conclusion that i am living in the dream world where true friendship exists. When one offers friendship, it is often accepted with the best of intentions in suspicions. That is a lesson learnt today. Another lesson learnt, that life is all about giving, to God and to each other; when i go through life each day, without even giving the best to what i am doing, and exhibiting what christians should do, offering their selfless sacrifice, one has not live truly and has at least failed God. \"God has demonstrated his love in this, While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us\" Romans 5:8 This is one of my most quoted verse of the bible to my students in Sunday School, or rather ex students, whom i have fondly remembered and my prayers that they will grow up to be strong in the Lord, one who will put God first in everything they do. All we can do, or rather all I can do, is show people Jesus, and i admit, i have no good testimony, i give up teaching, i disgrace God's name in so many times, and i am grateful that in his Grace and mercy, he forgives whenever i repent.

        "text": "Practitioners of polygyny in scripture Polygyny, or the taking of multiple wives by a singular husband, is a practice firmly established by righteous men in scripture, and even encouraged and caused by God Himself. David, king of Israel, had multiple wives. And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul; And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things. 2 Samuel 12:7-8 God gave David the wives of Saul, on top of the wives David already had. David's sin was not in taking multiple wives, but in committing adultery with Bathsheba, and having Uriah murdered in battle to conceal his sin. And look at what God told David\u00e2\u0080\u1e0a had his house, his wives, and his kingdom not been enough, God was prepared to give David more of all of these things! This includes more wives! Jacob, later named Israel, had two wives and two concubines. Read Genesis 29 and 30. Wives were Leah and Rachel, concubines were Bilhah and Zilpah. From this man and his four women came the twelve tribes of Israel. God specifically blessed Jacob through all of his women. Abraham had three wives \u00e2\u0080\u0093 everyone knows Sarah, but children are not taught about Abraham's wives Hagar and Keturah. And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife. Genesis 16:3 Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah. Genesis 25:1 Abraham was a righteous man in the eyes of God, and God never rebuked him for these wives, and even blessed him through the offspring of these marriages. Moses, the man God chose to lead His people out of Egypt, was blessed with two wives. And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter. Exodus 2:21 And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman. Number 12:1 Zipporah was from Midian, not Ethiopia, and was taken as Moses's wife before the exodus, while Moses was in hiding from Pharaoh. Additionally, Miriam and Aaron were punished for speaking out against Moses because of his second (Ethiopian) wife. Solomon is probably the most famous polygamist in scripture, having 700 wives and 300 concubines. And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart. For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father. 1 Kings 11:3 Solomon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fall is never described as his taking of so many wives, but in following after the gods of these foreign women. There are other examples, but these five should suffice to prove that: Polygamy is not pagan Polygamy is endorsed and provided for by God Polygamy was practiced by righteous men Tomorrow: God as a polygynous entity",

        "text": "Some things, some people, prove so important to kids, and in the course of their everyday, mundane lives, they never know the impact they've made on the little ones they touch. \u00a0 \"Kenny is the sweetest kid!\" I hear it everywhere I go! Especially from his teachers! Kenny is the kid every teacher wishes she could clone.\u00a0 It all began during a parent-teacher coference\u00a0in first grade when his over-fifty, experienced teacher gushed with tears in her eyes \"I have to tell you, I just love Kenny!\" And it was mutual. Kenny was so in-love with Mrs. Hotten that the love was transferred over to all things educational.\u00a0 Every child should be blessed with a first grade teacher who so loves her job that the children in her class are sad to go to second grade! Working in the high school, I see plenty of students whose first grade teachers failed to realize the importance of experiencing \"Henry and Mudge\" or \"Clifford the Big Red Dog.\"\u00a0 Personally, I have two favorites: \"Harold and the Purple Crayon\" and anything with \"Miss Spider\" in it.\u00a0 The illustrations in Miss Spider's books are so wonderfully created that the pages would be perfect for escaping into a fantasy. Kenny's first love is fairly obvious to anyone who has the opportunity to visit with him for ...a nano-second. It is his guitars that make the boy's heart pound like the drums in a head-hunter movie. I know, I've heard them when I watched him walk into the Guitar Center.\u00a0 He acquired this love of guitar through a music teacher who was donating his time at Kenny's elementary school when he was in the third grade.\u00a0 The minute he picked up the guitar, you could tell it was love at first sight. The polished wood of the guitar seemed to glow under his little hands.\u00a0 We purchased his first electric guitar for his ninth birthday: A BC Rich Warlock!\u00a0 Okay, so it's a little extravagant for a nine-year old. We wanted him to be able to experience his dreams early to see if they would stick.\u00a0Our neighbor bought him an amp (don't ask me, I don't know what kind.) to go with the guitar. Heaven for a ten year old boy is created with a nine year old girl, an 11 year old girl and\u00a0two 13 year old boy standing on the sidewalk as Kenny played the Star Spangled Banner, ala Jimmy Hendrix. The girls squealed, which is, I think, today's equivalent of swooning, the boys' heads jerked like the spasms of dying birds, which I take to mean enthusiasm. And Kenny? Kenny flipped guitar picks like Rick Nelson from Cheap Trick. It was genius, pure genius! Thank you Jeff Bretz for offering the time . You'll never know what you did for him. Lord, please bless all those teachers who heard your call, who make everyday an adventure for our children. Lord, to those who are discouraged, send a little blonde haired child who melts their hearts. To those who are tired, send a little red-haired\u00a0child to make them laugh. To those who are hurting, send a little dark-haired child to encourage their hearts.\u00a0 To those who have joy, please Lord, send my children. I thank you, In Jesus' name, Amen.

        "text": "Wake Me Up \u0093Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, \u0091Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous?\u0092 Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small doesn\u0092t serve the world. There\u0092s nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won\u0092t feel insecure around you. We were born to manifest the glory of God that is within us\u0085 And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.\u0094 Nelson Mandela Member class, doctrine class, small group, Christian growth, evangelism class, courses on finance and marriage and parenting, leadership training class, hermeneutics, spiritual gifts, biblical counseling, participate in missions, carry a significant local church ministry load. (my paraphrase) You could earn an MBA with less effort. But let me ask you: A program like this \u0096 does it teach a person how to apply principles or how to walk with God? They are not the same thing. Change the content and any cult could do this. Gandhi, Confucius, Jefferson, they all had principles for a better life. But only Christianity can teach you to walk with God. We forfeit that birthright when we take folks through a discipleship program whereby they master any number of Christian precepts and miss the most important thing of all, the very thing for which we were created: intimacy with god. Truth be told, you couldn\u0092t master enough principles to see you safely through this Story. There are too many surprises. Only by walking with God can we hope to find the path that leads to life. That is what it means to be a disciple. After all, aren\u0092t we followers of Christ? Then by all means, let\u0092s actually follow him. Not ideas about him, not just his principles. Him. A personal walk with God comes to us through wisdom and revelation. You will soon discover that we need both. When the apostles needed the help of some good men to shepherd the exploding new church, they chose men \u0093full of the Spirit and wisdom\u0094 Acts 6:3. The two go together; we need both. God has given us all sort of counsel and direction in his written Word; thank God we have it written down in black and white. We would do well to be familiar with it, study it with all the intensity of the men who studied the maps of the Normandy coastline before they hit the beaches on D-Day. The more that wisdom enters our hearts, the more we will be able to trust our hearts in difficult situations. Notice that wisdom is not cramming our heads with principles. It is developing a discerning heart. What made Solomon such a sharp guy was his wise and discerning heart. I Kings 3:9 The particular foolishness of the church in the past century was Reason above all else. The result has been a faith stripped of the supernatural, the Christianity of tips and techniques. We have our morals and we have our precepts, but where is the living God? Just a few of my notes from Waking the Dead",

About two weeks ago, we had a little heat wave here in Boston and the inside sales guys thought it was too warm so they asked maintenance to turn down the AC. They must have turned it to 40 degrees! I am so cold. My desk feels like an ice cube. It's also because it's so darn cold outside. We also had a really cold weekend (you really missed out Tanya). It never got above 55 all weekend. I had to work the Show House all day Saturday and got stuck outside in the cold and rain. Yuck. Best part is I think I'm getting a cold now. Yesterday was nothing exciting either. We had someone come and look at the apartment so I had to clean and then I headed to Hunt's to pick up some film for my two big weekends coming up. I also picked up a really cool camera bag that will hold all my lenses and my digital camera, all of it's parts and my SLR camera. That was the big excitement for the day. It's a pain in the rear to haul all my camera parts so I needed something for that. I also picked up the new Sex & the City DVD: Season 6, Part 1 as well as the new Hoobastank CD and a cute book titled \"The Devil wears Prada\" for reading on the plane the next two weekends. Very exciting weekend I must say. The next two will be much better though. :o) So on Friday Tara discovered the wonders of 7 for all mankind jeans. She emails me and says \"Aren't these jeans awesome?\" Why yes they are Tara. They aren't cheap but they do wonders for your hips and butt. I bought my first pair over a month ago and I must say it was the best decision. They are amazing! If you've never seen or heard of them, check them out for yourself. The founders are the ex-Levi's creative director and the ex-Gap head of denim. Pretty cool. My next pair will be the dark wash with the Pink stitching and pink \"A\" on the back pockets. They are super cute. Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

Jess and Paul's wedding is on Saturday so that's exciting even though we won't be there. I have a lot of junior league meetings going on this week. Tonight we have our general membership meeting where we can go to learn about all the projects for next year. I haven't decided what to do yet so the meeting will be very informative. On Thursday evening I have a junior league communications meeting at Summer Shack, all fun, no work. Then on Saturday I will be working at our Show House all day long. The junior league show house is really, really cool. If you love home decorating or home shows like Trading Spaces, you would love the show house. Basically, the junior league goes out and finds a large usually historic home and then designers all over New England bid on different rooms to decorate. After it's all completed, we open up the house to the public and sell admission tickets. It's our biggest fundraiser and it's a wonderful way to get ideas on home decorating. The cool thing about every room is that everything is for sale. Well this year it's at the Commandant's House at the Charlestown Navy Yard and I had to work it yesterday. The rooms are amazing!!!!! My job for four hours was the third floor (the house is four stories!!). I was in charge of the bridal room, the nursery, the navigation room, the nautical room and the novel room. Each room was so incredibly detailed and awesome. Especially the bride's room. The entire room was white with hints of lavender. It was definitely my taste. One designer downstairs dedicated an entire room as a modern looking martini room. It was very cool. Anyway, my job was to guard the third floor and make sure noone touched or stole anything. When I got home last night, I checked my email and Becca had sent me some samples of her bridal pictures. Doesn't she look absolutely gorgeous?!?!",

I think it was better than the first one despite Kirsten\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempt at acting again (I am so not a Kristen Dunst fan). Anyway, I highly recommend seeing it in the theaters before it leaves because of some great action sequences. Afterwards, we trotted over to Copley and did a little shopping. Andrew got a really great tie for super cheap; I got some naughties at Victoria\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Secret and then my cool new laptop bag at Sony that I mentioned the other day. I justified the cost of it because I did a really cool thing. You see I bought my laptop in Mass last weekend and we got our TV in NH. I decided that I was driving to NH to return and buy back my laptop in order to save $100 in taxes. When I called to make sure that I could do that, the girl just went ahead and did it over the phone! I got back $100! Score! So I decided to buy that bag I wanted. Here it is: I went with green because #1 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m really into green right now and #2 it was the only cute one that my laptop would fit into to. So I am really happy with it and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really hip and light with my computer in it. After our little shopping spree, we headed over to PF Chang\u00e2\u0080\u0099s for dinner for some Chang\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Spicy Chicken and Moo Shoo Chicken. It was very yummy. :o) Good evening!",

        "text": "A FORGOTTEN NIGHT AT THE OSCARS Andymatic had an interesting link to a cuddle party on his blog today.\u00a0 Basically, it's an event where people get together in a safe space where they can be physically affectionate in a non-sexual way.\u00a0 Think of building a fort with the cushions from the couch.\u00a0 I think it's a great idea.\u00a0 So many people in our country have so many barriers up and don't realize they are starved for physical affection.\u00a0 However, I will admit that I'm a little leary of letting anyone get too far into my personal space without knowing them.\u00a0\u00a0 However, there were a few Saturday nights after several drinks where I made some exceptions.\u00a0 Human behavior is so contradictory. I wonder if a cuddle party would be helpful for women who have been raped or sexually abused in their past or gay men who have recently been diagnosed HIV positive?\u00a0 Then again, how would would our girlfriends/boyfriends react to us cuddling with others?\u00a0 Could we have an open-cuddling relationship?\u00a0 What if you had the opportunity to cuddle with someone you found very physically attractive?\u00a0 Would the cuddling only excite you more or help you achieve a different space with that person?\u00a0 It's all very interesting. It reminded me of an experience I had many years ago.\u00a0 I had a friend when I lived in Dallas who worked as a male escort.\u00a0 In fact, he may have ran the company.\u00a0 He was never clear on the details.\u00a0 It was his nebulous edges that I found interesting.\u00a0 Anyway, one evening he asked if I would do a job for him and I told him no.\u00a0 He knew that I needed some extra money to pay an unexpected bill and my portion of the fee would be about $20 shy of covering it.\u00a0 He told me that the job didn't require any sex.\u00a0 It seems there was an older gentleman in town and he wanted company for the evening.\u00a0 It seems my friend overbooked himself or had wanted to spend time with his new boyfriend of the week.\u00a0 I think he actually told me one excuse before and one after.\u00a0 I agreed to do it, but I was a little nervous.\u00a0 So I drove the hotel, which I want to say was on the other side of I-35 in the designer district.\u00a0 It may have been the Marriot or the Hyatt.\u00a0 I can't remember now that I no longer live there.\u00a0 Anyway, I went up to the room and knocked on the door.\u00a0 A man in his late forties answered.\u00a0 He was dressed nicely and invited me in.\u00a0 He was an attractive guy and he may have carried a few extra pounds, but I found it odd that he would call an escort service for company.\u00a0 I called my friend to let him know I was there.\u00a0 There was a lounge area and we talked for a bit over some wine.\u00a0 We ordered room service and had dinner.\u00a0 Then we sat on his bed with our backs against the headboard and watched the Oscars.\u00a0 I think it was 1994.\u00a0 I remembered that he smelled very good and at one point he asked if he could put his arm around me and I told him yes.\u00a0 It felt nice.\u00a0 We laughed a lot and shared stories through out the shot.\u00a0 At some point, I fell asleep beside him and woke up later.\u00a0 The TV was turned off and he was watching me, smiling.\u00a0 I apologized and he said that he enjoyed watching me sleep.\u00a0 It was half an hour past the time I should have left.\u00a0 I told him that I enjoyed myself, but I needed to get home although I would have liked to have stayed.\u00a0 I put on my shoes and walked to the door.\u00a0 He told me I was forgetting something and motioned to the table where there were some neatly folded $20 bills.\u00a0 I told him I felt funny taking the money.\u00a0 He asked me if this was my first time and I told him it was.\u00a0 He smiled and put the money in my pocket.\u00a0 \"It's not a payment,\" he said. \"It's an investment in a bright young future.\"\u00a0 I smiled and I really wanted to stay the night.\u00a0 I didn't want to have sex.\u00a0 I just wanted to sleep beside him and keep him company.\u00a0 I moved toward the door and stopped. I turned around and said, \"If you're ever in town again, you more than welcome to call me.\u00a0 I mean, you can call me directly.\u00a0 I'd be happy just to share your company at no charge.\"\u00a0 His eyes smiled at me and he said, \"I don't know that my business is ever going to bring me back to Dallas, but... in another place and time, I would have liked to have met you.\"\u00a0 I knew I'd never see him again, but it had nothing to do with me.\u00a0 He opened the door for me and I turned to walk out.\u00a0 \"May I kiss you?\" he asked.\u00a0 I turned to him and\u00a0nodded.\u00a0 He put his hand under my chin and pulled my lips to his.\u00a0 It was a gentle kiss with a dash of passion that\u00a0made my lips hum.\u00a0 When he pulled away, my hand instinctively went to my lips to touch them.\u00a0 I looked into his eyes and said, \"Thank you.\" He looked into my eyes for a moment and said, \"No, thank you.\" Then kissed me on my forehead and I walked out the door.\u00a0 When I reached the end of the hall, I looked back before I turned and was still watching me.\u00a0 I waved and he smiled and waved back.\u00a0 On the elevator ride down I debated about going back, but my gut said that was the way it should be.\u00a0 For some odd reason, I actually followed my intuition and went home.\u00a0 I called my friend to tell him I made it home safely and then went to bed.\u00a0 For the longest time I kept replaying the events of the evening. I could not believe I had worked as an escort for the evening and earned $120 for not putting out.\u00a0 Maybe there was hope for gaykind. I went over to my friends apartment the next day and gave him the money.\u00a0 He was already tired of the boyfriend of the week and asked me how it went.\u00a0 I smiled and said that it went well.\u00a0 My friend asked if he tried anything and I said no.\u00a0 He counted the money and then handed me some back and then handed me an extra $20.00.\u00a0 \"What's this for?\" I asked. \"He gave you a tip.\"\u00a0 I looked at the additional $20 and was amazed that out of nowhere I now had enough money to cover the bill.\u00a0 \"Why did he do that?\u00a0 He paid for dinner and my time.\" My friend smiled at me as if were a child.\u00a0 \"He enjoyed your company.\u00a0 That's how he showed his appreciation.\" My friend tilted his head to the right.\u00a0 \"Are you sure nothing happened?\" \"No,\" I laughed.\u00a0 \"Why do you ask?\" \"He called today and said that you were exceptional.\u00a0 No one has done that before.\" I smiled.\u00a0 \"Does he call you every time he comes to town?\" \"Actually he was a new john.\u00a0 I'd never heard from him before.\u00a0 Do you think you may be interested in doing this again now that you see how easy it is?\" \"No.\u00a0 I think I'd rather quit on a high note.\u00a0 I just wanted to help you out, but... if he calls you again, let me know.\" My friend looked at me suspiciously and I realized that he would never believe nothing happened so I left. I never heard from the gentelman again and I lost contact with my friend about six months later.\u00a0 I think he moved to L.A. is what I heard.\u00a0 I wondered what happened to that gentleman and what his story was, but most of all, I hope he's doing well.\u00a0 However, sometimes I like to honor him when I have a college-age waiter who gives me good service and is personable.\u00a0 I'll tip more than I should as an investment in a bright future because there was someone who saw a spark in me when all I saw was blackness.",

        "text": "Ok so here is my post, again..I am a little new to this Blog thing but I am getting the hang of it....(Thanks Erin) Hey All! I think that I am the first person to respond to this weeks question. To all of you that might not know my, this is Ticia. I am an alumni from '98.' I couldn't make the weekend this year due to some personal matters (i know Matt my coolness factor has decreased) however I plan on being super involved from now on to make next years weekend rock as much and more than this years. I think that there are two possible ways to answer this question. This first thing to realize is do you mean the students that just completed the weekend, or do you mean involving more students to actually participate in next years weekend. If what you mean is to keep the students that just attened the weekend involved, the key is a well run and organized Alumni Program. This I can attest to from experience. I loved the alumni program when I completed my weekend, I used to commute 45 mins just to attend an alumni meeting. The alumni program I feel is the key to keeping the newbies involved. If what you are talking about is getting more students to participate in the actuall weekend I think that comes down to education and to publicitiy. I believe the education aspect of it is another way to keep the recent attendees involved as well. We should think about recruiting them to speak to the sophomores next year about what MASSStar is and maybe why they should want to get involved. Educating the schools even more than I am sure we have about MASSStar as well. I am sorry this is so long and these are just some basic ideas that I am sure can be developed into some great programs, with everybody's input and creativity. I look forward to working closely with all of you.",

        "text": "Hey all! Be prepared this is a long one, but there were a lot of things to be answered and discussed so that is my excuse. I would love to see MassStar alive and well in five years. I want to see us continuing to touch the lives of high school sophomores. My biggest hope would be to have a solid core group of returning volunteers, especially alumni. I would love to see us moving with the times and continuing to educate students with classic leadership skills as well. As ten years go by I hope that our numbers would continue to grow, with a strong alumni support system. I would hope to see new and improved platforms and discussion panels. My hopes for 15 years would be the same, maybe by this time we would be starting to expand into other states. I am not sure 15 years is along way down the road. MassStar will always be in Massachusetts but maybe like I said before we will start expanding to other states. If we do everything right (like we normally do) everyone will know about us. I believe with the intelligence, experience and passion of our volunteers that our curriculum, workshops, and activities can only become the best out there. We are a young educated passionate group of leaders working to pass along our knowledge. Our curriculum, workshops, and activities will always be deeply embedded with classic leadership qualities, however we will always progress with the times and the students that we are trying to reach. I am not sure how many students will be involved, but I would hope that as word travels among schools that more and more schools would wish to participate. Parental involvement is something that I have always wanted to see more of, however I am not sure how to get that to happen or in what capacity to use the parents. I do feel that if the parents are involved it will continue the growth process after the students leave the conference. Brand new things will always occur with so many creative minds working together. This is one of those things that we are just going to have to wait and see what the future and our creativity brings us. I know that this is rather longwinded and the answers are not completely definite, however we are involved in something that has so many variable all we can do is continue to work and do what we love, passing leadership on to the future. Smile everyone.",

        "text": "MADRID, Spain - The official death toll in the Madrid train bombings climbed to 191 after the Interior Ministry added an infant whose mother was injured in the attack while pregnant with the child. The infant died May 10, two days after he was born. His family said the child died because of injuries his pregnant mother suffered in the March 11 bombings blamed on al-Qaida. The ministry officially accepted that claim Wednesday, allowing the family to apply for compensation benefits, a spokesman told The Associated Press on Thursday. The official tally of people wounded in the attack is about 1,600, said the official. Previous tallies exceeded 2,000 for the bombings, Spain's worst terror attack. Also, Spain will increase the number of police officers dedicated to fighting the \"new threat\" of terrorism from one brigade to three, National Police Director Victor Garcia Hidalgo said Thursday. Some 650 more officers will be trained, including 22 translators, said Hidalgo, Diaz de Mera's replacement. More than 50 people have been arrested and 16 people, mostly Moroccans, jailed in connection with the bombings. -- My thoughts and prays are with this kid. The kid didn't even have a chance. That's sad. I am beyond words right now. I am so infuriated and enraged I can just punch a wall. These terrorists need to be stopped at all costs. I do not want to read about this crap again.

        "text": "From the Spectator : Dear Mary... Q. I find that I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember somebody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name for longer than 30 seconds after I have been introduced to them. It is worse at a party where I recognise people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s faces and suspect I know them well, but cannot remember who they are. Recently, at a fashion party, there was a typical worst-case scenario when I saw an old friend from university who now moves in fashion circles, and his name completely eclipsed [sic] me. Can you recommend a foolproof procedure that will work every time to prevent me from having these problems? I do not want to have to go on a five-day memory improvement course. S.G., London W8 A. In junior circles such as your own the mobile telephone provides an instant solution to this problem. Have it to hand as you go round parties, then, when you see a beaming stranger approaching, you are poised to present him with the device crying, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen you while I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got this in my hand. Would you mind entering your new details?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 In the pretence of admiring his dexterity, stand over him as he keys in his name. A BRILLIANT IDEA! Next, also from the Spectator: A QUANTUM LEAP Stephen Pettitt says that rock musicians who compose classical music are out of their depth A couple of weeks ago a press release arrived in my electronic in-tray. It was from Naxos, the record company much admired for its bargain recordings of a repertoire ranging wide and free over the thousand years or so of what we on my side of the business like to call Western art music. Naxos makes them cheap and turns in a profit by taking a chance on artists who might not have reached glamour status. Thus the company feeds on a thirst for repertoire, not on the cult of celebrity. Or at least that has been the case until now. The email I received angled for me to provide gushing coverage of a new, prestigious release, a recording with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, no less, of a newly composed orchestral suite. What could be wrong with that? The championing of contemporary music by such a label \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and it has already done good work in this department, not least by commissioning a whole series of string quartets from Sir Peter Maxwell Davies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is surely something very noble and desirable. The problem was that the composer of this suite, which is called Seven on the basis that it consists of seven movements, is one Tony Banks. Not the affable Labour MP, but, the bumf tells me, \u00e2\u0080\u0098keyboard player and composer for the progressive rock group Genesis\u00e2\u0080\u0099. Alarm-bells rang, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m ashamed to say that I responded to the email with a thoroughly prejudiced and uncharacteristically rude \u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh, God\u00e2\u0080\u0099 even before I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d heard a note of the work. When the product arrived, however, all my prejudices proved justified. Seven is nothing more than musical doodling. While it has some sweet ideas, its language is severely restricted. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t challenge, move, or inspire. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rather like the work of someone who has taken early retirement from a boring office job and has taken instead to painting naff watercolours of idyllic lakeside scenes and pretty thatched cottages. Therapy for the creator, maybe, but dull for any reasonably intelligent beholder. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more, as is common in such enterprises, in order to realise the piece for orchestra, Banks was obliged to engage the services of an orchestrator, one Simon Hale. Hale has achieved what any orchestrator should achieve: a professional if unremarkable job. But these days orchestration is an integral part of the creative process, not something slapped on to the music afterwards. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as if Banks had left the colouring-in of his naff watercolours to someone else. Of course, anyone \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even the odd critic \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is perfectly entitled to compose music if he or she feels so moved. My objection is not that Banks has done so but that we are being sold the line that his reputation as a famous rock musician is enough to guarantee that he can be a classical composer of interest and ability. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not true of Banks. It was not true, either, of McCartney with his Liverpool Oratorio (likewise orchestrated by another hand). It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not true even of the more sophisticated Elvis Costello, whose offerings with the Brodsky Quartet I have always found insipid and pretentious. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure what Banks\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business arrangement with Naxos is, but he was able to use the LPO, even engaging them for a second set of sessions (who paid?) because, unused to the way orchestras work in the studio and on his own admission, he was inadequately prepared for the first. Everything about this product suggests that Naxos is not as idealistic an enterprise as we first thought. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not alone. Projects like EMI Classics\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dreadful Queen Symphony, a tiresome sequence of cheap Hollywood-style epic climaxes, or more recently Sanctuary Classics\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bland crossover effort, Patrick Hawes\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Blue in Blue, betray a willingness to compromise standards for profit that goes far beyond the populist ethos of Your Hundred Best Tunes. At least they were all good tunes. Perhaps the most worrying aspect of the rock-musician-turned-classical-composer phenomenon is that it underlines the tendency nowadays to ignore the vast skills gap that exists between classical and pop/rock musicians, whether composers or players. I am not suggesting that people like Eric Clapton or Elton John are unskilled. Clearly they are not. But where many a classical musician could ape their achievements, is the reverse also true? Can John play the Hammerklavier? Would Clapton get his fingers around a Bach lute suite? For the record companies, however, the rule seems to be that if you are famous enough then you are good enough. For a would-be composer desiring to cross the great divide, the chasm between the two art forms is perhaps even wider. Consider what the genre of the pop song generally demands of its creator. At best it can approach the outwardly simple lyric subtlety of Schubert. But mostly as music it is pretty crude. No organic exploration (Mozart, Beethoven, Wagner), collisions of musical types (Monteverdi, Messiaen), or complex layerings (Bruckner, Stravinsky, Carter). No dynamic shading, since everything is loud. No subtle instrumentation. An insistent tribal drum thud. Limited harmonies. Normally, a rigid four beats to a bar, and an equally rigid tempo, defined in bpms (beats per minute). It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most often a music about pulse and power. Even in progressive rock, the spirit of musical adventure is severely restricted. Which is right, for its language suits its purpose. Given a rooting in a craft so formulaic, is it any wonder that a rock musician wanting to compose something more substantial, more classical, should find himself at sea? A quantum leap is demanded of him. Yet the message we are being given is that we must laud him, that we must accept that his music can hold its own alongside the wonders of Monteverdi, Beethoven, Sibelius, Birtwistle. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just snobbishness if we do not. Well, if snobbishness it is, a snob I will have to remain, for I find presumptuous this staking a claim on the territory of art music. Few rock stars know much about the commitment and skills that it takes to be a real musician, about the tedious hours spent practising each day, about the requirement to stand back and ruthlessly self-criticise, about the demands of getting inside a piece of real music. Few would tolerate the insecurity of an orchestral musician\u00e2\u0080\u0099s working environment, or know just how much courage it takes to mount the stage night after night and do the physically impossible. Few can contemplate the agonies that a composer puts himself or herself through in order to find the inner voice, the language, the form, the right sound for the moment. By all means allow the rock stars their indulgences, particularly if one consequence is that some of their wealth finds its way into real musicians\u00e2\u0080\u0099 pockets. But please do not try to sell it as something that it is not. Not to me, anyway.",

If you don't, let me be the one to tell you that they suck giant donkey balls! This weekend is going to be el weekend de relaxation. Hopefully. I'm already seeing my mother circling trying to make it as un-relaxing as possible, so we'll see how that turns out. Has anyone out there ever lived in a house where no matter how many times you remind someone of something, they just don't do what they're supposed to do? I do. As I left for work every morning this week, I remind mom to go to the store and buy some toilet paper because we're almost out. I'd do it myself, but the store here opens at 8 and I'm already gone by then, and it closes at 8, and I haven't been home by 8 in the last three weeks. And there is no store between here and work (sad to say, this town is larger than the two I have to drive through. Combined). So, here I sit on Saturday morning waiting for someone (mom) to go buy some damned toilet paper. We're completely out. Three bathrooms and not a ply anywhere. Nothing. Nadda. Zip. Zilch. Zero. Her excuse for this? \"I refuse to pay an extra $2 for toilet paper in the grocery store!\" Okay, that might seem like a fine idea to anyone who's never been here, but that store is the only store in town, and the only one you'll find for 30 miles (20 if you're in search of a convenience store, but that's north and nobody ever goes north unless they're going to Minnesota, and once you get past that convenience store, you have another 75 miles to go to find anything). So, here we sit on Saturday morning without toilet paper, because mom hadn't found a \"good\" reason all week to go to the town 30 miles over, and so hasn't bothered to replenish the TP supply. I made her go this morning after I ran the three miles to my grandparents house to use their toilet paper and then ran back. The grandparents weren't up yet, so I scared the hell out of them by letting myself in. Grandpa came downstairs with a tennis racket, just like a grandpa in a cartoon would. But I will say, that was the best on-the-fly breakfast I've had in years. Three hours later, mom is still in search of toilet paper and I'm contemplating another run. At least I'll get dinner in between. And really, isn't it all about the food?",

This laptop is less than an inch thick and weighs at around 4.7 lbs. I am stuck with this laptop until I graduate from college. I'll afford a better one by then. Shit, with an Access Virus, I have not to worry. Nobody can fuck with me. I'm laying down the grimiest shit. Strictly club fuckin bangas. I had to get rid of my PA system but fuck it. I need a synth.

I have 13 cousins on my dads side so you would think more people were going cause they usually do. Whatever, I have to sleep over there anyway so it might be better that I dont have to deal with them for 2 days. They're all wicked cool for their age though. They range from age 1 to 16, lets see if I can name all the cousins. Jessica Austin Sarah Katie Kevin Joel Jack Renee Jamie Devin Emily then me and my brother. Whew thats a lot of words. Anyway I just bought a PS2 and Champions of Norrath for a total of $130 on eBay and I think a new PS2 is 200, Im not sure though. I got a good deal anyway. Thats the game that Nick and I played in our free time in Marthas Vineyard, we'll see how long Im obsessed with it. The last game, I was obsessed with it for a total of 1200 hours. Thats how many I put into the game (PSO). The runner up is runescape but that doesnt tell you how many hours so I guess I played it for a few hours a day for at least 5 months. Yes yes its sad but now Im so used to doing things other than staying home that I wont be able to sit and play it all day. Just for a week cause Seans in Maine, Russell has summer school and I just spent a week with Nick so he might want to give it a rest for a few days. Thats convenient.",

        "text": "Ok, so heres the low down on Minneapolis, Minnesota. I decided to make a list. First, we'll start with the positives, then the things that I personally found just a little strange, then the negatives. Positives~ 1. The city is really pretty, not very big, but nice. 2. Even though it's really cold in the winter, it doesn't get cloudy, it's like always sunny, just freezing. 3. The kids I met were nice, even though they were a bit Minnesotan . Ok..well those are all the positivies I can think of for the moment....maybe more later. Strange Things~ 1. It's so cold in the winter that in the city they have sky walks between all the buildings so that you can basically get anywhere in the city without having to go outside. It's like a big hampster cage or something. 2. All the people are that super friendly that kinda creeps me out, like they're all actually about to explode and kill someone. 3. The kids that I met last night, they have this saying, where they say \"Oh you totally tweeked\" or \"She's tweeking\" I have yet to figure out exactly what this means. 4. There are about 8239047459860 lakes in Minnesota, on their license plates it says \"10,000 lakes\" and the lakes freeze in the winter because it's like -30 (maybe not really but thats what it feels like) and for fun, people DRIVE THEIR CARS on the frozen lakes. And I thought there was nothing to do in Darien. Negatives~ Basically, the city is nice, and I'm sure the people who live here like it, but it's not home and it's not the people I love. And it wasn't until I left home that I missed the comforts I didn't even know I had, and the people I didn't know kept me alive. I don't think that I would fit in so well in Minnesota, I don't say things like \"dont'cha know\" and \"tweek\" and I'm not super peppy all the time. Oh, and just in case you were wondering, in the midwest, sweatshirts, and straight legged jeans never went out of style, netiher did mullets. Anyways, thats the low down on Minnesota. I have to go now because I have to visit 2 schools before I finally come home. Bye bye. *~Spinnin, laughin, dancin to her favorite song. She's a little girl with nothing wrong, and she's all alone.

Even if I were to tell her what a slime he is, and what he did to his old girlfriend, she wouldn't listen. She thrives on going against what people tell her. She would just probably go out with him faster or something. ARGH! Seriously, this all makes me sick. Incredibly sick. He's going to hurt her like he hurt his last girlfriend. Man, that kids probably going to be an abusive husband someday, but the problem is, he seems ok normally, but he's so impulsive, and argh. Abusive relationship. He's going to hurt her. I can see it now, but she wants someone so much that she'll go for him. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. This is so bad, and it really really truly bothers me. On a happier note, I talked to Joanne on the phone for a long time tonight. It was so nice. Ah, I love her! But, I just can't get this other thing out of my head. He's going to hurt her, and not just emotionally, but probably physically too. He's going to ruin her, crush her, strip her of her dignity. And in the end, I know I'll be right, but it wont feel good to say, \"I told you so.\" Whenever I'm so rarely right, it's bad if in the end it wont feel good to say that.

The long term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience\u00e2\u0080\u1e0aI will dispense this advice now. Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth; oh nevermind; you will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they have faded. But trust me, in 20 years you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked\u00e2\u0080\u1e0a.You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not as fat as you imagine. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry about the future; or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubblegum. The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind; the kind that blindside you at 4pm on some idle Tuesday. Do one thing everyday that scares you Sing Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be reckless with other people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hearts, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put up with people who are reckless with yours. Floss Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t waste your time on jealousy; sometimes you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ahead, sometimes you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re behind\u00e2\u0080\u1e0athe race is long, and in the end, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only with yourself. Remember the compliments you receive, forget the insults; if you succeed in doing this, tell me how. Keep your old love letters, throw away your old bank statements. Stretch Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel guilty if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what you want to do with your life\u00e2\u0080\u1e0athe most interesting people I know didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives, some of the most interesting 40 year olds I know still don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Get plenty of calcium. Be kind to your knees, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll miss them when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re gone.

Dance\u00e2\u0080\u1e0aeven if you have nowhere to do it but in your own living room. Read the directions, even if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t follow them. Do NOT read beauty magazines, they will only make you feel ugly. Get to know your parents, you never know when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be gone for good. Be nice to your siblings; they are the best link to your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the future. Understand that friends come and go,but for the precious few you should hold on. Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle because the older you get, the more you need the people you knew when you were young. Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard; live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft. Travel. Accept certain inalienable truths, prices will rise, politicians will philander, you too will get old, and when you do you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll fantasize that when you were young prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders. Respect your elders. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect anyone else to support you. Maybe you have a trust fund, maybe you have a wealthy spouse; but you never know when either one might run out. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mess too much with your hair, or by the time you're 40, it will look 85. Be careful whose advice you buy, but, be patient with those who supply it. Advice is a form of nostalgia, dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth. But trust me on the sunscreen\u00e2\u0080\u1e0a",

        "text": "I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve survived one of the worst days since Adrian\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m happy to say I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m feeling much better today. Thursday was the pits, overwhelming sadness with a migraine and the shock of Adrian being gone hitting me all over again (what's with that?). Actually the day felt like being tossed in the ocean with drowning waves of grief and I had to hold on until time passed and I could fall asleep. But I made it and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m really thrilled. One step away from overwhelmingly bad days is comforting, in a strange sort of way. So you ask what made Thursday so much worse than all the other day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve survived without my beloved hubby? Simple, carry over from Wednesday when Rebecca and I went to the dentist. Something as naturally frustrating as no parking spaces (I've never had a parking problem there before, and it made the whole time at the dentist hurt)made me realize what fragile ground I stand on. As a treat after I took Rebecca out to dinner (a fun pizza and pasta place Adrian and I kept meaning to try). At first she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to since it reminds her too much of daddy (I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been out to dinner in 9 months since he died, oh once with Grandma Donna for Rebecca\u00e2\u0080\u0099s birthday in October). The word 'pizza' was all I really needed to say and she became eager! Dinner out devastated me (seemed totally weird without Adrian) plus I actually ate pizza and the cheese made me sick (not used to rich food, Adrian loved cheese though, and now we don't stock it at home). The hole without Adrian seemed so wretchedly huge, and dinner out magnified our loss. When we got home Rebecca ate some cookies and I started craving these. She said something that sounded exactly like Adrian \u00e2\u0080\u009cgo ahead and just eat one and stop talking about it\u00e2\u0080\u009d. That broke me up (though really Adrian used to say it in a nice joking way and so did Rebecca). For maybe the first time since Adrian died I really felt the need to overeat. Almost to chase away the hole, which was the stupidist thing for me to do. I was scared at how powerful my feelings were to overeat and fill the void. I could've eaten the whole box but I stopped maybe at 8. I had to go upstairs and go to bed; just a horrible out of control feeling. But thankfully passed. I weighed in this morning at 125 and felt so much better (dropped 2 pounds since the pizza and cookies) and actually felt a sliver of happiness. If I develop a weight loss obsession (just joking), maybe I can cope better with the loss of Adrian (I still weigh 10 pounds less than last year and 30 less than 2 years ago). Thursday we had a surprise newspaper delivered to our driveway (also pushed me further into drowning water). Wow something as simple as the newspaper on the driveway reminded me of our life together, albeit in a good way, and how much has changed for me (plain scary). I kept looking for messages from Adrian and this article, which I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have found on-line, gave me hope in the future: \u00e2\u0080\u009cA group of 26 retired US diplomats and military officers said yesterday that President Bush should be voted out of office in November for damaging US national security interests and America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s standing in the international community.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Exactly! About time some people of influence spoke out. I'm tempted to move to Guernsey when Rebecca and I visit in mid-July (for a month!) but not really, as she is settled here. Yesterday the sun shining (like a slap in the face) and forcing myself to work out didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help me feel ok. Really I could not wait for the day to end, I never had these feelings when Adrian was alive! Rebecca had such a rough time last night too, but woke in far better spirits. She said things like \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish daddy were the one here and you were gone\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re so bossy\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009creading is so boring\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so mad at daddy for dying and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just too sad to talk about\u00e2\u0080\u009d. I think all this stuff is so important to get out and I'm glad she was able to say it (instead of getting mad and door slamming). She also said \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not a baby, so I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Well I put that myth to rest. She was in a great mood this morning though she is naturally sad about school ending (at least she can still see her teacher, but not Daddy--bah wah). I still can't believe it's the end of the school year, but that topic is for another post. I took Harry for an hour walk this morning (well he took me for the walk). We are starting to train him to heel just for walk to the bus stop, almost 1.5 years after we've had him. My walk this morning was nice with the sun shinning (I was ok with sun today, though it just feels so \u00e2\u0080\u0098mean\u00e2\u0080\u0099, which shows you how sensitive I am lately). I tried hard to just appreciate being alive (not always good at that, but at least I make the attempt). Key for me, I survived last night (despite some weird lightening storm); all I wanted was for the day to end (as fast as possible). Yes I dreamed about Adrian and that helped (even though it was the scary repetitive dream I have about the ambulance taking Rebecca away from us). One moment at a time and today is mow the lawn and massage day, and Friday thankfully! I can do it??? Do you think??? Thanks for listening.",

I heard some of their songs today, and one I really like. I can't remember it exactly, but Little Lindsay is burning me a CD with some of their songs on it, so it'll be Song of the Day tomorrow.

        "text": "for the longest time (really about 3 years) i have been asking my self, \"self, why did you spend the majority of your youth as a republican?\" i've been racked with guilt. barely able to live with myself! today i was reminded of the answer. npr aired a commentary on reagonomics this morning, providing snippets from reagan's inaugural speech in 1980. reagan made lots of lofty promises to scale back the government and deregulate the economy. in addition he vowed to cut taxes and curb government spending. (he did the former but actually upped the latter in the effort to bankrupt the soviet union.) anyway, i'm going to avoid critiquing the merits of reaganomics, mostly because i have no idea what i am talking about. what i am going to do is justify my life as a republican for, oh let's say, 11 years. by the time i got to high school and began to learn what the parties stood for, i really felt fortunate that i actually agreed with the ideologies of the republicans that i had been identifying myself with up until that point. (come on, unless you're alex p. keaton, you just kind of go with the family flow.) from what i remember, and i won't claim that it is much, repulicans = less government and democrats = more government. that was the fundamental basic that i remember being pounded into my brain over and over again. from where i stood, less government sounded great! i don't want the government telling me what to do after all. the great fucked up thing about this is the fact that this is not what the parties PRACTICE at all. i just didn't notice that. (i was an academic type who dealt more with ideas than reality.) i guess i kind of feel like the parties hopped in bed with the educational system to pull the wool over my eyes. today, it is clear that the republicans are not about less government. much to the contrary. the fcc is a great example because, of course, it is a matter of national security if i see a little t & a on the boob tube. if something isn't done, i may not be able to have an abortion... even if i NEED one for medical reasons. now, i understand that the republicans do support less government when it comes to protecting the environment & meeting the medical needs of the sick/elderly, but who in their right and socially conscious mind could be in favor of such things? ok i'm sick of typing about this, so i'm not even going to bother wrapping it up and making a nice neat little point. bottom line, kerry in 2004!",

        "text": "The two armies face one another across the narrow pass. The earth is squeezed at this point into several impossibly narrow defiles between land and sea. To the north are the shallow silver-blue waters of the Malian Gulf. To the south is the steep face of Mt. Kallidromos \u00e2\u0080\u0094an ironic name given its English translation from the Greek: \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe good path.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To the mighty invading Persian army, there is nothing good about it. It is an insurmountable barrier that keeps them from attacking the left side of the Greek line. While its slopes are not sheer, they are steep enough to disallow the Persians access to any sort of flanking maneuver. A carpet of dry brushwood cloaks the places on the slopes where the bare rock of the earth itself has failed to poke through. Higher up, above this area of chaparral is an oak forest near the beetled summits. The air is redolent with the scent of the sea, the sage and thyme of the mountainside and occasionally, the distasteful sulfur odor from the natural hot springs close by. The sheer visual effect of that brooding mountain at whose very feet lay the shore of a gently lapping sea is spectacular to the point of incredulity. But more incredible still is the sight of the men who are sent to hold the Pass. Lacedaemonians. Spartans. A distinct breed of warrior whose existence can only have been created in a land of such ruggedness. They are dressed for battle and stand stiffly at attention in perfectly formed phalanxes across a wider part of the pass. In their solidity, they seem almost to be a natural extension of the mountain, an adamantine bulwark of bronze. There is an awful grandeur about them, a disconcerting and terrible sense of single-mindedness in their demeanor. And it is a ruthless devotion to discipline that keeps them standing straight, immobile, unflinching at the sight of the mighty Persian war machine\u00e2\u0080\u0094many times their number. Their expressions are unreadable behind the cheek plates and nose guards of their tight fitting Corinthian helmets, the tops of which carry red- and white-dyed horsehair plumes. It makes them seem more an unwavering line of machines than men. Yet, men they undoubtedly are. Men honed to a paradigm of physical proficiency not seen before by the invading host. The fluttering blood red cloaks of the officers are the only things that bestow any sense of movement upon the scene. More of that terrible bronze is sheathing their chests and covering their sturdy legs. Their arms, meaty and darkened by a life spent exercising in the sun are gripping spears whose bronze tips glint with a palpable and sinister sense of impending peril. And lastly, there are the huge bronze shields. Each of them held rock steady in front of the cuirasses and bearing the great pyramidal \u00e2\u0080\u009clambda\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the Greek alphabet. It represents Lacedaemon, their home and country and the reason they have arrived and are prepared to defend to a man, the Pass of Thermopylae.",

Ahh, to be in the waves, and throw jellyfish at unassuming friends... Finished reading \"Fight Club\" again. It was a hard book for me to read, since it deals with hitting bottom, trying to attain complete self-destructiveness. There were parts that made me cry, softie that i am, but it's one of those books that's worthwhile to read. No sign of Herr Landlord. He makes me feel the same way CJ did, (CJ was the stalker who died of exposure a few months back) I feel bad for him, his debts, and he seems like the sort of person that no one can relate to; and that's immensely sad. On the other side of things, he's a pain in the ass, creepy, and lately, scary. I have this weird hate-want-to-feel-compassion for him, but I can't, he scares me too much and has not been overtly nice in the past. I no longer have the need to squeeze his neck until his head pops off, though, and i think that's an improvement.

        "text": "When I've been trying to think of the last time I really fell in love was. I think it was sophomore year of college, to a cute freshman named julie. We read each others poetry. Then I think she kinda fell for me, whcih scared the living piss out of me. So I told her that she should date the boy that had been interested in her when I showed up. Then when he broke her heart, I was the one that took her out so she could grieve. Unfortunately for me, it was too late to have her fall for me. She married this past summer. I need to call her and see about a dinner. Since that time sophomore year, I think I've hidden my feeling better, made sure I didn't fall for them any more. I think for better or worse, I've had to lose some compassion along the way. It's also caused me to have respect for women in general. Not to say that I should put every woman I meet on a pedistal, but perhaps I shouldn't be thinking, \"How can I get in her pants?\" Although, before I have always not thought about getting into her pants, and that hasn't gotten me anything but a plethura of female friends. Which is good, I like female friends, but I think I'd prefer female lovers:) All this to say that if you're my friend and you're female, there's a chance I want to get into your pants:) But not because I am in love with you :( Catch you on the flip side-",

        "text": "I just want to start by saying that I vehemently disagree with a lot of what's been written in the past two day. I also strongly disagree with a lot of your opinions about politics and voting. First and foremost, I disagree with the idea that if I am against Bush being in the White House, then my only choice is to vote for Kerry. I don't agree and I never will. I am not going to vote for \"the lesser of two evils\". I just won't do it. I don't like Democrats anymore than Republicans, including the world-class bullshitting Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton is not a great man, contrary to how some of you individuals have trumped him. Let's not forget, he doesn't know what the definition of \"is\" is. I will vote third-party simply because I refuse to buy into the theory that a third party vote is a wasted vote. I think that any vote that isn't for something that I believe in is a wasted vote, regardless of weather I'm \"giving a vote\" to Bush or not. Another thing, I think people that don't vote have every right to bitch about how fucked the country and/or president is. I didn't vote in the last election and I bitch about Bush all the time. Reason being, as an American, I have the right to bitch. I also have the right not to vote. Voting is a right that cannot (in theory) be taken from me. It's not my duty to cast my vote for one of these two fucks. I'd never vote for Gore, nor would I vote for Bush. But as an American, I have every right to express my discontent with either of these stupid fuckers, vote or no vote. There is nobody worth voting for. I'm not a liberal or a conservative. What I am is someone that's disgusted with the current state of the nation. Do I think Kerry is going to change shit? No. Do I think Bush is going to be any less of a fuck? No. Am I going to vote for either of them? No. But what I am going to do is vote. And I'm voting third party. Because I'm not going to let others tell me that there is no point. The reason it's pointless is because everyone buys into the theory that a third-party vote is a worthless vote. Oh well, it's still a vote, and I don't feel it's a waste. I'm making a choice because I want CHANGE, not just a swing of the guard. It's an old boys club up there at D.C., and they need to go. Maybe people will stop listening to naysayers and start listening to their heads. Until then, I'll be the idiot tossing away his vote and bitching about the assholes YOU voted for.",

This dream's really weird and I have it every week or two. Now, this is another weird ass dream that I have sometimes. I'm inside of this computer game Doom and I am scared out of my mind because I'm in Hell, like in the actual game. I see the monsters like from Doom I and II and it's like real life. The eyes and everything. I see the red ball monster with all the eyes, the imps, the skulls on fire. But, in this dream, I don't have any guns. I see a shitload of potion everywhere though which is useless to me since I'm just constantly running away from these monsters. And, I'll open this door and all of a sudden, everything I see turns into like psychadelic hippie vision. Everything turns purple, yellow, orange, and pink. These monsters still look scary as hell though. I have also been having this recurring dream of the Alesis Andromeda A6. In this dream, I own this synthesizer, only it's modified and has this tube light on it that lights up when I press down on a key. I dream of making these really crazy sounds and then I'll wake up thinking I have an Andromeda, but I don't. This dream sucks. I've been having these dreams for a while now. When I say a while, I mean, since I was like 18 maybe? That's about six years. When I used to have the dream where I was flying, I would be a vampire and I'd be hunting for human blood and flesh to eat. Now, this doesn't happen anymore. But, I used to dream that I was a vampire and I had this appetite to destroy humans by tearing them apart with my vampire powers. Yea, I know. I'm fuckin nuts. Last night, I had the Doom dream though. I was stuck on solving this puzzle to get out of where I was trapped. I had to push this lever, go to another room and push a box into a wall, then when I went back outside, everything was different and I couldn't find the door to escape and I just totally forgot altogether where the fuck I was supposed to go. The whole time, it doesn't occur to me that I'm dreaming. Sometimes, I wake up in my dreams while I'm dreaming and I realize that I'm dreaming. usually, when this is the case, I change the channel and surround myself with bikini girls on a beach island and a bunch of drinks with umbrellas in them. I'm dead serious. Or, if I'm not in the mood for that, I will say to myself, \"If I'm dreaming, then I'll manifest a gun.\" Then, a gun will manifest in my hand out of nowhere and I'll start shooting at anyone that I see like I'm in a video game, but it looks as real as life. I forgot the term used for being able to do this. But, it's really fun to control dreams.",

Anyway not much to mention other than I had a rather interesting dream last night; I sit with a few friends on a bench next to a man; the man is of 60 years of age and is very thin, his clothes hang off his frail body and his skin is unnaturally white. While I am sat next to him I am conscious that he is evil and planning on stealing something off me so I try to get up and move away except I can't. Stuck fast I wait and eventually he gets up and I stand up at the same time, he then goes to embrace me and I reach to protect him from stealing my watch, I hold on tightly to it so that eventually he realises he can't get it and subsequently walks off. I then realise that he was Father Time. Looks like this was just a short one. Again.",

        "text": "Okay, so this is my first post on Blogger.com. I did have a blog of some sort on Xanga, which is another one of these webblogging tool sites. I found out about this webblog site from Call For Hell on TechTV last night. The sad thing about that is that it was the very last Call For Help, which was running on TechTV for six years. Most of the people that watch TechTV know that TechTV was bought out by ComCast, one of the largest cable TV providers in the country. It will be combined with ComCast current video game network, G4 on May 28th. When my parents were looking to get rid of Adelphia as their television provider, I suggested when they went looking for a satellite option, that they get a package with TechTV included, saying it was a really cool station to have. The way that I ever knew about TechTV is after I was on a trip to visit my best friend Jon at SUNY Fredonia, we stopped by another high school friend Angela's room, and watch it. After the parents bought the Dish network setup and the package with TechTV included it soon became the channel that was on the family's living room television most evenings. With the announcement on Leo LePorte's blog on Leoville about the fact that ComCast was buying out TechTV and that most of the people currently on air were to be fired, in many ways it seemed like soon we would be going back to standard broadcast stations, since most of the other channels offered on the Dish are pointless. I was going to be the first one to lead the charge against the ridiculous killing of one of the best television channels out there, by one of the country's largest mega-cable-corps. Besides, it seemed in a lot of ways that G4 was complete crap, and all that ComCast was going to do is try to kill off something that was better all around channel that actually had good content and organization then a straight up completely console and computer game focused station. After seeing a bit of the programming being preview on TechTV over the last few weeks, all hope might not be lost. The first program that impressed me was Icons, which talks about the history of some of the biggest video game makers in the world. It also answered one of my longest unanswered video game questions: \"Why is Final Fanstasy RPGs always call Final Fanstasy, if there is about 11 of them now?\" Other programs such as Filter, which has a hot Asian chick on it, and Arena that is pretty funny since they are doing play-by-play of Unreal Tournament 2004 games might be entertaining at the very least. So, I guess at the moment ComCast will be spared my wrath. But with the lost of Call For Help, the only consolation is that The Screen Savers will be saved, along with X-Play. Gentlemen, we all know what is the best think about X-Play is not their rating system but Morgan Webb. With all that said now, I'm off to do some more research on the differences of PHP, ASP.net, and a good forum creating tool.",

I thought that today would be a good day to start. A new turnpoint in my life has started, one that has hit me hard. My mom and my stepdad are divorcing, and it has caused turmoil in my head. So much is going to change, and I don't want it to happen. Even though I'm not moving to a different state (like I have many times in my life before), it's still different. The family that I have learned to love is going to be torn apart, and it's all too much for me to handle. I found out that I can't cry anymore, since I just tried a second ago, teary eyes and that was about it. Don't get me wrong though, I'm not depressed, just... um... shocked, and apparently I don't take great amounts of shock too well. I'll get through it though, I always do. On a happier note, I finished watching Tuck Everlasting (a movie that I haven't seen in a LONG time) a little while ago, and I developed a new favorite quote: \"Do not fear death, fear the unlived life.\" Great quote...

        "text": "MSNBC published a piece today reporting that a recent poll, printed in the Le Parisien , showed that less than 50% of the French population feel that they have a moral debt to the U.S. for the D-Day liberation 60 years ago. The thing that I'm wondering is whether the sentiment reflected in the poll is the result of the French's criticism of the U.S. was in Iraq. It is sad that current events are being used to devalue the sacrifices that so many made in the past. Regardless of the merits and justifications for the current war in Iraq, it does not change what happened in the past. Just as the French argue that the U.S. had no justification for the current war in Iraq, it can be argued that the U.S. had no obligation or reason to drop thousands and thousands of their own into enemy territory to liberate a country who, while touting themselves to be a \"Great Power,\" utterly failed to protect its own, and saw the enemy march through the streets of Paris. No matter the resentment that the world may feel about the war in Iraq, no one can say that what the U.S., as a nation, and as a people, as well as the British, Canadians, and others of the Allied Forces did on D-Day in Normandy do not deserve the thanks of a nation and perhaps even the world. A question that I want to ask all those who said that there is no debt owed to the U.S. is whether they feel that they owe a debt to anyone for D-Day, and if they feel that they are in debt to the rest of the Allies, what makes the U.S.'s participation in 1944 any less important or deserving? What is happening in today's world has no impact and makes no difference to what happened in Normandy. For those who feel no debt, think that if not for D-Day, France today would be the province of France, not the Republic of France. Those who died in Normandy did not fight so that they can hold you in debt, but a debt is owed nonetheless.",

        "text": "A minister friend of mine whose husband is a prison chaplain emailed me and\nasked me this question\u2026\n\"Duane, when you preach in prison, how do you differ your sermons,\nillustrations, examples, style?\" ****\nThis is how I answered.**\nThe only way I can speak about how I \"differ\" in ministry is to look at the\nways I minister.\nI \"preach\" the same for the most part wherever I am in a preaching setting,\nie. church, church services in prison, a chapel service at Teen Challenge,\nchurch service in Africa or Mexico, etc. I may at times use different\nillustrations and examples depending on what will relate to the people I am\nspeaking to. The same could be said for teaching in a class room setting. I am\nwho I am and my \"style\" is my style. I do not try to be someone different. I\nbelieve people see right through when you are not yourself or you try to \"do\"\na particular style. In fact, in prison I think they are even more aware of\nanyone who is trying to be something they are not. They can recognize a con\njob a mile away.\nWhen I preach it is predominately lecture, but even then I generally will find\na way to interact and get responses from the crowd or single out individuals\nfor a response. When I teach I prefer to use a discussion style teaching\nenvironment. I ask and answer questions. Groups of four to forty are better\nfor this than a large congregational setting. In the prison this has worked\nvery well once you have earned the respect of the men you are teaching and\nhave made them feel comfortable sharing and asking questions in front of\nothers. The biggest difference in prison is that you usually have more time to\npreach or teach than you do in a typical church setting. That and the fact\nthat no one can get up and leave if the clock strikes twelve. :-\\)\nI might add that I do my best to communicate in vocabulary that a twelve year\nold can understand no matter who i am speaking to. If I do that then those\nwith a college education understand as well as those who are young in either\nage or education. Too many people think using more advanced vocabulary makes\nthem sound smart. My assertion is: What good does that do if I have not taught\neveryone? Two events made me re-think my ways and adapt to this way of\nteaching. One was in a church where a deacon came up to me after the service\nin a small community and said to me, \"That was a great message, but only half\nof the people here understood what you said.\" The other event was in a prison\nwhen I used the KJV during a teachings session. One of the more educated\ninmates asked me afterward why I would use the KJV when the majority of the\nmen in the room did not understand the language used. From then on I have\nconcentrated on using simpler vocabulary as best I can. It has become my habit\neven when I write. Sure. I do not write or sound as smart as some of my peers,\nbut I do communicate and that is my goal. I will let my peers be admired as\nthe super intellectuals. That does not matter to me as much as communicating\nto the masses.\nAll of that said, there are times when I preach and teach in settings that are\nnot typical or traditional settings. Those are settings that are more similar\nto what Dr. Brad was talking about that he has in the cafe. In those settings\nI do not usually have a prepared message, notes, or even a bible. You do not\npreach at, but rather answer questions. It is risky in some ways, because you\nare on the spot and must spend as much time listening to both the person and\nthe Holy Spirit at the same time. The Holy Spirit will use their background\nand ways of understanding to guide you in how to communicate to them. What is\nmost essential here is having the respect as a spiritual leader from the\npeople you are speaking to. This is done either by spending time with them and\nearning their respect or by having someone they respect vouch for you. The\nlater is the way I do ministry in the tattoo parlor in El Paso. I might add\nthat I do not know how the Holy Spirit gave George, the owner, the respect for\nmy ministry that he as. He contacted me and not the other way around. I think\nit was just a pairing that God did for both he and myself. God does that part.\nGeorge hand picks people who are showing they are susceptible to the gospel\nbut do not trust traditional ministers. He brings them in to meet me and may\nsay something like, \"You have a lot of questions and this is the guy with the\nanswers.\" (Talk about being put on the spot) Then there is a time of them\nchecking you out to see if they can trust you and a bonding time.\nIn His Service,\nR.

It isn't\nneccessarily because I am buying things. Actually come to think of it, I've\nnever bought anything on e-bay. My first experience with e-bay was by fluke. I\nhad an extra bottle of Pro-Activ Refining Mask. Whenever I purchase the Pro-\nActiv kits, it comes with a free masque. Something that I rarely use. So while\nI was cleaning my room, I figured it would be a brilliant idea to sell it on\ne-bay. I thought it wouldn't even sell, actually to be honestly, I thought no\none would even noticed it. But sure enough within seven quick days, I got my\nfirst sale and it was great. Someone profited from me because I sold them the\nitem for half the price. I profited by not having so much clutter within my\nroom.\nEbay full blown. No no\u2026I am not a power seller or anything. My brother came\nhome to visit from Alberta and we ended up cleaning some of the rooms in our\nhouse. While we were cleaning, we were coming across really old toys. Remember\nback in the days from the early 80's, all kids had POPPLES? Well, if you do\nhave them and don't care for them. DID THEM UP. People around the world are\nbidding on these little suckers. My brother also found my Baby Cub Surprise. I\nwas about to dump this all into the garbage can when I figured it wouldn't\nhurt to look up the value of some of these vintage toys. Some of them were\nranging anywhere from a couple dollars to $30-$40. Really wouldn't you love an\nextra $30-$40 you didn't have to waste your day at the office to get? So I\nstarted putting up a few of my brother and my old toys on ebay and sure enough\npeople are purchasing them. It's great, one person's junk is another person's\ntreasure.",

        "text": "The immense fanfare, the hypocritical publications, the orchestrated\nconfusion, and the tragic-comical jubilations about South Sudan's referendum\nfor independence herald an ominous future. The presence of a great number of\ncolonial countries' representatives, the involvement of Freemasonry / Zionism-\ncontrolled diplomats and mass media, the eagerness of companies and\ncorporations to urgently sign deals of all sorts, and the emergence of various\ntroubles at the local level bear witness to the well-known duplicitous stance\nof the colonial countries which has been attested over the past 250 years.**\nIn South Sudan, an explosive situation is under formation, and there are\nstrong chances for the new country to become a perfect reincarnation of Sudan\nitself, with the Dinka alone or the Dinka and the Nuer playing the role of the\nArabic speaking central Sudanese in 1950s' Sudan.\nTo shed light on the existing problems and to give space to representative\nvoices coming from South Sudan's indigenous peoples, I herewith republish an\narticle, which was written a few days ago, and a comment posted in response.\nQuite meaningfully, the article's title ''I Don't Support Land Grabbing\nAnywhere in South Sudan'' does not refer to land grabbing carried out by\nforeigners or non African businessmen but by locals - against their own\nneighbours who belong to another nation.\nAt this point, it may be worthy remembering that in 1956, when Sudan became\nindependent, this issue did not even exist. This shows already that South\nSudan starts from a point worse than that attested in the inception process of\nSudan. One may always wish to hope, but hope is real only when America,\nEngland, France and Israel are not there - which is not the case for South\nSudan.\nBy **Gordon Buay**\nSunday, 02 January 2011\nFor quite a while, a certain Peter Karlo has been spreading unfounded\nallegations that I support land grabbing in Upper Nile State. This Peter--who\nis not Peter in the new testament in the bible--went as far accusing me of\nbeing part of what he called \"Dinka--Nuer coalition\" that he portrayed as a\ngroup that wants to grab Chollo lands in Upper Nile State.\nI want to make the record straight to Peter Karlo. The argument that ensued\nlast time between me and Dr. James Okuk was about the cosmopolitan nature of\nMalakal town. I don't think Mr. Peter Karlo would provide tangible evidence in\nthis forum implicating me in any land grabbing in South Sudan. The problem of\nland dispute between Chollo and Dinka of Upper Nile State was not part of the\ndebate I had with Dr. James Okuk. Our debate was based on cosmopolitan nature\nof Malakal town and its inhabitants. Areas that belong to Shilluk (Chollo) in\nUpper Nile are known and nobody would dispute them because there are\nadministrative records that show the areas occupied by the Shilluk since 1956.\nThe CPA too is very clear on the issue of land ownership. Any land occupied by\nthe Shilluk after January, 1, 1956, belongs to the Shilluk and no tribe, be it\nNuer or Dinka, should claim any Shilluk land as theirs without violating the\nCPA and the administrative records known to the people of Upper Nile.\nBesides, the South had a government from 1972 to 1983 that mapped out areas\nwhich belonged to the Shilluk. There are areas that some tribes may claim now\nwhich were administered in the 1970s as part of Shilluk land. Any reasonable\nSoutherner, including myself, would agree with historical records that areas\nthat belonged to Shilluk in the 1970s must still belong to Shilluk in 2010. If\nthere is any Nuer who migrated to Shilluk land after 1983 war, I would urge\nthat Nuer to vacate the Shilluk land. If I am a governor of Upper Nile State,\nI will order the security forces to evict Nuer who occupied the Shilluk lands\nin a minute.\nI believe in the principle of justice and I am not somebody who can support\nglaring injustice. If the administration of Simon Kun Puoc, the governor of\nUpper Nile State, fails to adhere to administrative records of the 1970s to\nsolve ongoing land disputes in Upper Nile State, I, as a person believing in\njustice as fairness, will not support him. If there are Shilluk lands grabbed\nby the Nuer and Dinka, the governor has a responsibility to correct the\ninjustice. He can form a committee that will unearth the administrative\nrecords of the 1970s and address the disputes accordingly. If there are\nShilluk lands the Nuer and the Dinka grabbed after 2005, the governor should\nreturn those lands to Shilluk. This is the matter of the principle of justice.\nI believe as a person that the principle of justice should not be contaminated\nby politics of expediency that bedeviled Upper Nile State since 2005.\nWe as South Sudanese should differentiate between the right to live in a state\ncapital and the ownership of land. I don't have a right to grab land in Yei\nthat belongs to somebody under the pretext that I am South Sudanese. I have a\nright as a South Sudan citizen to work and live in Yei provided that I live in\na plot of land that I either acquired legally or rent from the landlord in\nYei. If I grabbed land in Yei by force, then, any argument I put forward will\nnot be valid because there is no law in existence in the modern world that\nwould permit me to grab somebody's land. The Europeans did land grabbing 300\nyears ago under the pretext that they were occupying \"no man land\". We all\nknow that North America was inhabited by Natives--it was not a \"no man land\".\nSuch a thing cannot be allowed to exist in South Sudan in the 21st C.\nBut it is very important if we don't confuse ownership of land by the\ncommunities and the attempt of some to reject certain ethnic groups to live in\nstate capitals. Every Southern Sudanese has a legal right to live in Juba or\nMalakal provided that he or she does not live in the city by grabbing\nsomebody's plot of land. I have seen with my eyes in Juba in 2008 some mad\nindividuals who took plots of lands which belonged to others by force. It\nshould not be so hard for us to conclude that any Southerner who took land in\nJuba from somebody because he or she possesses a gun is a criminal. If we have\na functioning government in Juba, those who grabbed other people lands should\nbe legally evicted.\nHowever, those who legally bought lands in Juba or rented them from their\nrightful owners have legal rights to live in Juba whether they are South\nSudanese, NGOs, or aliens irrespective of their ethnicity, race and section.\nSince 1956, there are Northern Sudanese who legally acquired lands in Juba and\nhave been living there ever since. Those northern Sudanese have legal rights\nto own the properties they legally bought and nobody should take their lands\nbecause they are northern Sudanese. The same thing applies to other South\nSudan tribes who are not originally from Juba.\nWhat is criminal though is the behavior of some guerrilla fighters who grabbed\nlands in Juba or Malakal because they have Russian AK-47. People who grabbed\nlands any where in South Sudan, be it Yei, Nimuli, Malakal, Gogrial, Wau or\nJuba, through barrel of the gun, are criminals, period. This does not need\ndebate and if the South has a real government, the land grabbers who acquired\nlands because of the barrel of the gun should be locked in prisons. I will not\nhesitate to jail them for life if I am a governor or president of South Sudan\nbecause permitting those criminal activities is not only the violation of\nSouth Sudan constitution but it also erodes the very reason why we took up\narms in 1983. We did not go to bush to grab Dinka land, Bari land, Nuer land\nand etc. We went to bush to correct injustice and any reasonable Southerner\nwho believes in the principle of justice cannot tolerate a mad SPLA officer\nwho grabbed lands because he has AK-47.\nBy **Dr James Okuk**\nCorrection of Gordon Buay for straight records:**\nMy past debate with Gordon Buay and others was not about the cosmopolitan\nnature of Malakal town because this is obvious even for a child who is\nlearning to talk. Instead, the debate was about the nomenclature of one of the\ncounties in the Shilluk Kingdom called Makal County whose Headquarters is in\nMalakal town, and with authority to levy taxes there because it is considered\npart of its territory.\nThat debate came about because the Minister of Information and Broadcasting of\nUpper Nile State, H.E. Dr. Peter Both, posted some information on the\nregistered number of the the referendum voters and their counties where he put\nin his list a name of a county that does not exist in Upper Nile state; his\nso-called Malakal County. He did not apologize for the error and so some of us\nconsidered it intentional.\nThe debate got heated up and more personalized to the worst when Mr. Gordon\nBuay tried elusively to support his argument by a phone call he made to the\nCommissioner of Upper Nile State Headquarters Affairs, H.E. Mr. Simon Duop,\nwho told Mr. Gordon (if it was true) that he is the Commissioner of the ghost\nMalakal County.\nI requested Gordon Buay and his supporters to provide any legitimate evidence\nof their Malakal county but they failed to produce any one. But when I\nproduced the legal evidence of the formation of Makal county, Mr. Gordon came\nup shamelessly to disqualify it with request that I take it back to the\narchives because it was a useless document issued by a deceased rebel leader,\nDr John Garang de Mabior (May his good soul rest in eternal peace!!!). This is\nwhere I rested my case because I realized that I was just wasting my time with\nsomeone who does not believe in truth even when it is shown in a broad\ndaylight.\nNote\nPicture:** South Sudan\nFrom:** http://free-oromia-free-oromia.blogspot.com/2010/11/south-sudans-\nquest-to-be-eac-member.html South Sudan: US - UK Interference, Colonial\nPractices, Biases & Gogrialization Rejected by Nuer Will South Sudan Be an\nIndependent Country?

        "text": "Atlanta CPA: Providing Management Information to Atlanta Business Owners by\nCritiques to Internal Financial Statements\nAsk Not What God Can Do for You but What You Can Do for God\nAs Believers we all need to be more intentional about being Mission Minded. I\nbelieve many churches in America have become too much of a church that has\nbecome talkers of the word rather than doers of the word. I believe America's\nchurches need to spend more time relative to its importance as taught in New\nTestament teachings. As believers we need to do much to affect change and to\nhelp people see themselves as the actual hands and feet of Christ in a lost\nand fallen world in their home, work, school, neighborhood, shopping etc.\nAmerica's should be an equipping station, just like a gas station is to a car,\nand Believers should go to church to get charged up and then to head out into\nthe world to serve others. The last thing Christ said before he ascended into\nheaven was to go out into the world, leaving us with these as his last and\nperhaps more/most important words. I believe shocking the church body at\ntimes, such as having church acted out in the streets of America, rather than\non church on a given Sunday would do much to help change old paradigms.\nSee what YOU can do in your church and in your community to be the hands and\nfeet of Christ and to serve the lost, the last and the least.\nRemember Christ did not go to the church/synagogue to see how me might\nvolunteer, He just went out into the world and did it.\nJust Do It. He did. He laid it all out on the line so that we might live.\nJohn 15:1-2 \"I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener. He cuts off\nevery branch in me that bears no fruit, while every branch that does bear\nfruit he prunes so that it will be even more fruitful.\nDARE...Are You Seeking to be Daring in Your Mission Work.

        "text": "2010 Releases / Review: Phish - Live at the Legendary Alpine Valley Music\nTheatre\nOn August 14th and 15th, 2010 Phish played at Alpine Valley Music Theater. The\nAugust 14th show is the focus of the\n_Alpine Valley DVD_ , which was released on December 14, 2010.\nThe box set features the complete August 14th, 2010 performance on 2-DVDs, as\nwell as 2-CDs, and bonus video featuring highlights from the following night,\nincluding \"AC/DC Bag,\" \"Divided Sky\" and \"Stealing Time From The Faulty Plan.\"\nThe three-song combination that opened set two of the 15th rounds out the\nbonus material with \"Ghost,\" \"Theme From The Bottom,\"and \"Big Black Furry\nCreature From Mars.\"\nBut enough with the marketing bullshit. Quite simply stated this set rocks.\nThe audio of the recording is superb. It was recorded using 57 channels of\ndigital multitrack and mixed and mastered in 5.1 Dolby surround and PCM\nstereo. In short, it sounds great. And if you turn it up very loud, it sounds\neven better. In fact, it probably sounds better than if you were at the show.\nThe video was a 7-camera shoot, which helps keep the visuals as interesting as\nthe audio because, let's face it, Phish doesn't use pyrotechnics, and Trey\nAnastasio is not known for jumping around he stage like a lunatic. The\nmultiple cameras provide terrific perspective of Phish doing what they do\nbest, playing their asses off and having a great time doing it.\nThe band was on fire during this performance, which is what really makes this\nset a worthwhile viewing and listening experience. It wasn't a flawless\nexperience by any means, but these guys play, jam, improvise, and play the\nhell out of their music. It's a real treat to see and hear Phish play live.\n_Live at the Legendary Alpine Valley Music Theatre_\nis one of the best CD/DVD sets I've watched in quite a while.\nTube\nThe Oh Kee Pa Ceremony\nSuzy Greenberg\nFunky Bitch\nReba\nFuck Your Face\nAlaska\nBack on the Train\nWhen the Circus Comes\nLawn Boy\nSparkle\nGumbo\nRun Like an Antelope\nDown with Disease\nWhat's the Use\nScent of a Mule\nMike's Song\nDirt\nSneakin' Sally Thru the Alley\nWeekapaug Groove\nBug\nQuinn the Eskimo\nThe Oh Kee Pa Ceremony\nSuzy Greenberg\nFunky Bitch\nBack on the Train\nTaste\nWhen the Circus Comes\nLawn Boy\nSparkle\nGumbo\nRun Like an Antelope\nAC/DC Bag\nOn Your Way Down\nDivided Sky\nStealing Time from the Faulty Plan\nDavid Bowie\nDown with Disease\nWhat's the Use\nScent of a Mule\nMike's Song\nDirt\nSneakin' Sally Thru the Alley\nWeekapaug Groove\nBug\nQuinn the Eskimo",

        "text": "5 months.\nThat's how long its been since last I posted to this online reserve for words\nand images.\n5 months is a long time for me to not write anything down.\nAt first I felt as though I desperately needed to be writing, which quickly\nturned into a worry that I wasn't writing, and finally, over the course of 5\nexcruciating months, I realized that I had needed to not be writing.\nHindsight, as they say, is 20/20, meaning in this case that all becomes\nclearer the farther you move away from it.\nAs the dust settles on the frenzy that was my first solo show, Carnivora, I've\nmade peace with the inevitable adrenaline depleted lull that results from\nrunning the human engine at so high a level for so long. Coupled with the\nwithering winter weather that settled upon us through November and on into the\nnew year I think it accurate to say that I retreated into a safe space within\nmyself. It was a space where I could slowly attempt to understand everything\nthat had happened over the course of the last two and half years and begin to\nglean what lessons there were to be had from the experience.\nIts taken me nearly all of this time to be able to say it aloud, but Carnivora\nwas a success. In many ways it exceeded my expectations and yet in still other\nways it failed to meet my admittedly lofty hopes. That's as real world as it\ngets.\nCarnivora succeeded via the generous amount of media attention heaped upon it\nand yet, like so many other artistic endeavors of the day, struggled beneath\nthe burden of our faltering economy. The turn-out was beyond my wildest hopes,\nwith over 300 people in attendance on a night whose\nweather veered towards the biblical (2, not 1, tornados descended upon the\nmajor metropolitan area that night.) After the fact, at the start of 2011,\nF.A.M.E. NYC, an arts and entertainment focused blog, went so far as to\ndeclare Carnivora the \"\nthe turn-out was beyond my wildest hopes...\nAnd yet, I felt deflated upon its closing: very nearly tearing up the last\ntime I turned out the lights and walked away from the space.\nYou see, it took me 3 months to realize that it wasn't about the sales or the\ngalleries, or even the flattering media praise heaped upon the exhibition. It\ntook me another 2 months to realize I wasn't just telling myself that. In the\nend, I realized it was about doing it. Actually making it happen.\nConceptualizing the idea behind the project, creating the work, convincing\nothers that it was worthy of being shown to the world, and then showing the\nwork! Truly it was about the journey and not the destination, which\nironically, was something I told myself throughout the project, but managed to\nforget at day's end.\nAnd then\u2026 I realized it was time to do it all over again! That's when I\nstarted rubbing my hands together and muttering \"what next, what next?\" with a\nwicked gleam in my eye.\nSeptember 2009\nBlogroll\njasoncovert.com - The Collected Artwork of Jason Covert",

        "text": "15 January 2010**\nToday was one of our slow days making the majority of it less than interesting\nto read about. Truthfully, I think that we were enjoying the homeliness of\nJeff's pad which (together with Chris') made such a delightful change to the\nvarious low rent accommodations that we have slept in over the last five\nmonths that we felt no real need for entertainment over and above that which\nit provided.\nJeff lives a ten minute walk from the beach and Gregg was keen to get his\nboard out so, sometime in the afternoon, decided to take Angus (Jeff's dog)\nout for a walk in order to give him some exercise and also to check on the\nsurf. A little later he disappeared out of the front door, board in hand,\nsaying I have no wetsuit so I won't be that long\u2026eventually he returned. I\nknow that he knows what he is doing in the water but, when he goes out without\na mate, I always worry that, if he got into trouble, there would be no one to\nhelp him out.\nAnyway, by the time he returned, Lydia was home from work and **View from\nMount Keira looking East (ish)**\nI had found a film set in Liverpool (The Crew) on TV that I settled down to\nwatch. Ten minutes in, Lydia was asleep on the sofa and I found Gregg asleep\non the bed (I had had a few minutes shut eye myself whilst Gregg was communing\nwith the waves) so I persevered with the film by myself. I say persevered for\na reason, it is absolutely no exaggeration to say that I have absolutely no\nidea what that film was about other than violence and a gang, yet I had to see\nthe ending.\nJeff had returned by now and we all got ready to go out for our second Barbie\nin two days - which, obviously, impressed two Brits considerably. This time we\nvisited Jeff's friends, Brendan and Linda and their two children, and were\ntreated not only to a great meat feast but also an amazing potato bake. Linda\nshared the recipe but I am not quite sure that I can remember it.\n16 January 2010**\nJeff was not working today and, after an early morning (ish) run with Angus\nthe dog, offered to tour guide us for the day. This **Further view from Mt\nKeira**\nwas fantastic not only for the 'guide' part of the equation but also because\ntoday was the first day that we have really seen the sun since we arrived in\nAustralia AND because Jeff's car is a recently renovated (I am sure that isn't\nthe technical term when referring to a vehicle) 1966 split screen VW Camper. I\nthink I may have travelled by a similar mode of transport in the mid eighties\nby the parents of a school friend\u2026maybe\u2026but even then, I guess, we had no real\nidea of what a classic this vehicle would become. As I sat in the back seat,\nlistening to the loud hum of the engine and the babble of Gregg and Jeff\ntalking I felt really rather privileged.\nFirst stop was Mount Keira which laid on stunning views of the coastal plains\nof Wollongong below. As we stood on the first viewing platform looking east\ntowards the sea, we noticed an unusual take on the commemorative park bench -\nthe engraved padlock. The railings up there are covered in these small records\nof memories and, whilst I do love the benches at Treyarnon, it strikes me that\nthis is a great space-saving **Stick looking art**\nway to remember a special or sad occasion that allows for many others to enjoy\ntheir own memories in the future. It was also interesting to note how many\ndifferent types of padlock and engraving have been used. The engraving on one\neven looked like it had been carried out by hand and protractor.\nFrom this vantage point Jeff was able to point out the different suburbs of\nWollongong and I think he was slightly bemused by Gregg's desire to know which\nof the suburbs were more desirable than others. I think, perhaps, we were\nshowing our Englishness.\nOn returning to the camper, we got an insight into what it means to own one of\nthese things - people gazing admiringly into the windows and taking photos. I\nthink Jeff finds it a little tedious, and who can blame him, but people are\njust fascinated by them - especially ones that look as pristine as this one\ndoes.\nWe then headed back down the mountain and decided to check out a folk festival\nthat we had seen advertised. Seeing the word 'folk' I think we all thought\nthat it would probably be cheap, or free, to enter **View from Mount Keira\nlooking south (ish)**\nand that that would make it a suitable way to while away an hour or so. It was\n$45 entry so we \"did a U'ey\" and, instead, headed for Bald Hill Headland\nReserve for an ice-cream/sorbet (as soon as we were out of the camper the\nhoards began flooding to take a look and mutter things like \"awesome car\",\nwhilst Jeff just left them to it) and a spot of Hang Glider watching. To boot,\nthe views from this headland were amazing and we were able to see a\nconsiderable distance along the coast.\n...sorry Jeffin the title) before returning home to regroup.\nLater, the four of us headed down to Port Kembla beach for a dip. The day was\nso hot that the, verging on cold, sea was a real tonic. The waves were a\nlittle too big for me though so I beat an early retreat.

Varrock is the oldest\nsurviving human settlement outside the Kharidian Desert still in good\nconditions in the world today. It was founded when a tribe found a baby\nabandoned, and took it as a good omen. The baby eventually became Arrav, a\nfamous hero.\n---|---\nThe people of Avarrocka became very powerful, and conquered their neighbouring\ntribes, eventually forming the first human nation, Misthalin. Misthalin in the\nmid-Fourth age, however, was little more than a rough conglomeration of\ntribes, all of whom paid homage to Avarrocka.

It is currently unknown\nif the Mort'ton have been affected by the hazes several times since its\nfoundation.\n---|---\nDwarves make contact with the surface Late 4th Age to early 5th Age\n---\nRuneScape. The Fifth Age has thus far been a time of amazing strides for the\nGielinor largely due to the discovery of runes at the end of the Fourth Age.\nPositive advances in humanity's lifestyle include military, technological,\ntheological, philosophical, political, and economic strides. The Fifth Age, as\na result, has been referred to by some as the \"Age of Humans\". Humans\ndiscovered an unknown object in the far north of Gielinor, which allowed them\nto access the\n---\nStone of Jas Rise of Kandarin\n---\n7 | According to the Varrock Museum, Saradominists led by the Carnillean\nFamily decided to remove evil influences from the area now known as Ardougne.\nThey would eventually rise and create Kandarin the largest nation in the\nworld. One of Zamorak's chief agents, Hazeel, was probably sealed away during\nthis.\n---|---\nKing Raddalin, the King of Asgarnia, helped the Kinshra to build a large\nfortress in the North of his land. It turned out however, that they and the\nWhite Knights were bitter rivals and Asgarnia has been on the verge of Civil\nwar since.\n---\nAsgarnia Construction of Mage Training Arena\n---\n9 | Increases in rune production lead to wider availability of Magic, which in\nturn lead to an increase in Magical injuries. A tragic accident involving a\nfamous Wizard eventually lead to the construction of the Mage Training Arena.\n---|---\nMage Training Arena Construction of Varrock Sewers\n---\n17-20 | In the year 17, King Botolph, the monarch of Varrock at the time,\nordered construction of a sewer system for Varrock Palace.

Delrith was recently defeated once again.\n---|---\n23 | Vampyres took control over Northern Morytania once again. Humans in one\nvillage transformed into Werewolves, but it is unknown how this happened.\nCastle Fenkenstrain's inhabitants manage to stand up against the influence of\nvampyres.\n---|---\nCastle Fenkenstrain The Runecrafting Crusades\n---\n42-62 | During this time barbarians of the north felt that the creation of\nrunes should be left to the gods. In an attempt to make this happen barbarians\nlaunched a brutal campaign across northern Kandarin and Asgarnia. These\nbarbarians had sympathisers from the kingdom of Misthalin, and, during the\nyear 47, they destroyed the Mage Training Arena. By year 62 the barbarians'\nforces were wavering, and so they settled in\n---|---\nGunnarsgrunn with the intention of re-grouping and continuing their mission.\nFremennik Destruction of Imcando Dwarves\n---\n60-70 approx | The thriving tribe of Imcando Dwarves were nearly rendered\nextinct during the assorted Barbarian invasions. Survivors are scattered\nthroughout Asgarnia, a handful living on Asgarnia's southern peninsula.\n---|---\n70 | After the discovery of magic, a wizards tower was created on an island\noff of Draynor Village. Both mages from Saradomin and Zamorak alike studied in\npeace there for a time, until the Zamorak mages, who sought complete control,\nburnt the tower destroying countless irreplaceable tomes. After the burning,\npublic outrage followed in Varrock which eventually lead to the discovery of\nthe Dagon'hai's plans in the Tunnel of Chaos. Secrets of runecrafting were\nforgotten to most humans for nearly a century. The Moon Clan, however,\nretained runecrafting skills, although they used Lunar Magicks instead of\nstandard magic.\n---|---\nDark Wizard Creation of the Tunnel of Chaos\n---\nElder Kree'nag The great carpet crash\n---\n76 | In the year 76, the Sultan of Al-Kharid was killed in a flying carpet\ncrash.

King\nUlthas saw them as good men so he gave them a mansion in his kingdom to set up\na new Camelot. Lord Sinclair, the previous owner of the land, agreed that\ntheir need was greater than his, and agreed to move himself and his family to\na smaller residence in the North. Legend says that one day King Arthur will\nreturn to Britain.\n---|---\nKing Ulthas Dividing of Ardougne\n---\nReldo Trimmly Theft of the Shield of Arrav\n---\n143 | The Phoenix gang, an organised crime syndicate in Varrock, stole the\nShield of Arrav from the Varrock museum. Some of the Gang members split to\nform the Black Arm Gang. The gangs have a fight, and the shield of Arrav is\nbroken, each gang taking half.\n---|---\nShield of Arrav Pests invade Gielinor\n---\nVoid Knights start battling with pests, strange creatures who have invaded\nGielinor from another dimension. Scabarites Late 5th Age | A high priest of\nScabaras is tricked by\n---|---\nSecond Necromancer Assault of Varrock\n---\n154 | During this year, the Mahjarrat Lucien launches an assault on Varrock\naided by many fellow necromancers like\n---|---\nKing Vallance 162-163 | King Vallance, king of Asgarnia, gradually falls ill\nand leaves the running of the Kingdom to Sir Amik Varze, leader of the White\nKnights.\n---|---\nSir Amik Varze Outlawing of the Kinshra\n---\n163 | The white knights take full control of Asgarnia and immediately outlaw\nthe Kinshra.

        "text": "How to choose a boys camp\nAttending a boys camp is a turning point in every boy's life. So, parents must\nchoose with care.\nSince there are dozens of boys camps scattered across the US and Canada,\nchoosing the best is something of a challenge. Here are some tips to help you\nchoose the right camp.\nThe early bird:\nIt might surprise you to know that many families start the process of\nsearching for a boys camp almost a year in advance. Indeed, many reputed camps\nget filled up very soon and bookings are made 6-8 months in advance.\nTherefore, it is essential to start your research early on.\nFamily decision:\nBundling your boy off to a camp without involving him in the decision is\nprobably the shortest route to mutiny and disaster. Instead, search together.\nGet the entire family involved so that your boy knows that great care and\nthought has gone into the process of ensuring the best camping experience.\nCamp programs:\nDifferent boys camps offer different programs. Some camps are for day campers,\nothers are residential. Some camps further religious education while others\nare for delinquents. While some focus on general activities, others are more\nspecialized. There are camps dedicated to high adventure, sports, computers,\nrobotics, cooking, arts and crafts and so on. In short, you can get the right\ncamping experience for your child provided you take the time to find out what\nis being offered.\nLength of the program:\nAs previously mentioned, day camps are just for a day or half a day.\nResidential camps may range from 2 days to weeks or even the entire summer.\nThe length of the camp makes a huge difference in the effectiveness of the\nprogram. Longer camps encourage greater skill development even though they are\npricier.\nCost:\nMany reputed boys camps offer the best in terms of staff, equipment and food.\nThey offer a healthy staff to camper ratio and are always working on improving\ntheir facilities. Thus, it is only natural that they charge somewhat more than\ncamps that compromise on the above. However, high cost is by no means the\nhallmark of a great camp and parents must check the credentials of the camp\nfrom references.\nLocation:\nIf it's your boy's first time, you may feel more comfortable sending him to a\ncamp that is somewhat near your house. If you're after a great camping\nexperience, you may want to identify a camp that is somewhat farther away. On\nthe other hand, if the camp is too far away, you may need to deal with travel\nexpenses too.\nAccreditation:\nWhile accreditation is not a necessity, many parents feel it safer to send\ntheir boys to a program that has been evaluated and approved. If the camp is\naccredited, they make it a practice to adhere to high standards of safety and\nhealth.\nReferences:\nA great boys camp will only be too happy to provide you with any number of\nreferences. In fact, you may be surprised that some of your own neighbors or\nrelatives have been a part of these camps.\nWith the above points to guide you, finding the right boys camp is child's\nplay!\nCamp Pathfinder offers boys summer camp which is a unique, high-quality\ndesigned program to bring out the best in boys ages 7-15 years.\nMore Tips:\nSubmitted under Camping\nBuzz Up Digg Mixx Twitter\nEmail Print\nCurrent Delicious Diigo Facebook Fark Google LinkedIn Live MySpace Newsvine\nPropeller Reddit Slashdot Sphinn StumbleUpon Tip'd Yahoo!

Cates has appealed his dismissal to\nthe civilian Fire and Police Commission, which has the power to give him his\njob back.\nThe woman's account suggests the system designed to protect the public from\nrogue police officers broke down at several levels.

You'll learn all\nabout the tiny Canadian company set to soar, along with two other amazing rare\nearth opportunities.\nBut before I tell you more about these specific opportunities you'll want to\nknow a little background information. So let's not waste another second\u2026\nYour Crash Course on Rare Earths**\nNone of these \"Rare Earth\" elements are famous like gold or sliver. None gets\nshipped in giant ore freighters, like iron, aluminum or copper. You sure don't\nlearn much about these 17 elements in high-school chemistry class, unless\nmaybe it's the school that feeds lots of kids into MIT or Caltech.\nIn fact, the only people who really study these elements are master's- and\nPh.D.-level chemists and solid-state physicists. Oh, and national leaders in\nplaces like China - see below. But without these elements, much of the modern\neconomy will just plain shut down.\n\"Just plain shut down? C'mon,\" you might say.\nBut yes, these elements are critical to the modern economy, and that is not\nhyperbole.\nThe _New York Times_ calls them, \"the world's most obscure, but valuable\nminerals.\"\nWe are addicted to rare earths as much as we are addicted to oil, except most\npeople don't know about the rare earth addiction. But I am going to explain it\nto you in this report - along with three amazing ways to profit.\nSay Goodbye To TV Screens, Computer Hard Drives, GPS, and More\u2026**\nThese 17 elements are strategic. They play a critical role in petrochemicals,\nenvironmental protection, \"clean\" technology, electronics, automotive\napplications, optics, telecommunications, computing and defense. They are\nindispensable to a myriad of intermediate and end uses.\nReally, without these 17 elements, you can say goodbye to much of modernity.\nThere will be no more television screens and computer hard drives, fiber-optic\ncables, digital cameras and most medical imaging devices.\nRare earths possess unique magnetic, electronic and optical properties that\nyou don't find in any other groups in the periodic table. This is because of\nthe quantum physics that control the electron structures of these elements.\n_Within all the realm of materials science, these exotic elements may be the\nonly bridge\" to higher levels of dramatically improved performance._\nThat is, rare earths are the key to possible improvements in numerous metal\nalloys, electrical and magnetic properties, optical properties and instrument\nsensitivity. If mankind is ever going to live in a Star Trek-like future, this\nis how we'll get there. It's safe to say that we're still near the beginning\nof the knowledge base in terms of knowing what rare earths can actually\naccomplish.\nYou can say farewell to space launches and the satellites that do everything\nfrom show you the weather to offer global positioning down to a few inches.\nAnd the world's system for refining petroleum will break down, too. That's\npretty serious.\nIn fact, without these \"technology metals\" many modern technologies would\ncease to exist - including millions of\u2026\niPods\u2026\nHybrid car batteries\u2026\nCordless drills\u2026\nDigital cameras\u2026\nDVD players\u2026\nFlat screen televisions\u2026\nLaptops\u2026\nCell phones\u2026\nImagine your life without all of these modern day technologies.\nHeck, imagine the economy without them!\nBut even more important is their use in our high-tech strategic military and\ndefense systems. Because ALL of the really advanced weapons use some amount of\nrare earths - all of 'em!\nFor example\u2026 we couldn't manufacture jet engines without rare earths. Or\nadvanced radars. Or rocket engines and the satellites that the rockets blast\ninto orbit\u2026 our military's \"eyes in the sky.\"\nYes, guided missiles and other precision weapons rely on rare earth metals and\nmagnets to help direct their course.\nJust the critical military uses alone could bring huge BILLION DOLLAR\ngovernment contracts to this tiny firm, and potentially explosive returns to\nsavvy early investors.\nIn 2010, President Obama's Department of Defense budget ballooned to a\nstaggering $533.8 billion!\nSo you know that American defense spending isn't going down significantly\nanytime soon.\nRight now, almost all of the world's supply of rare earths comes from China,\nwhich is why our non-China investment opportunity is so appropriate. Before we\nget to the actual investment ideas, let's look at the setting for this\nopportunity.\n_\"There is Oil in the Middle East; There is Rare Earths in China.\"_** _\n_\n_~Former Chinese Premier Deng Xiaoping_\nChina is one of the very few places on the planet where rare earth metals\nexist in areas large enough to be mined.\nChina also holds the world's largest known reserve of rare earth metals.\nSo much like OPEC controls oil; China controls the market for rare earths.\nDefense News reports, \"China today controls 97% of the world market at the\nvery time rare earths are in soaring demand.\" You heard that right - 97%!\nChina also controls pretty much 100% of the world's rare earth refining,\nalloying, and manufacturing. (To be perfectly straight and accurate with you,\nthere are some small, laboratory-scale operations here and there in the West -\nbut nothing at a major industrial level.)\nYet China didn't always dominate the global rare earths market\u2026\nUp until the 1990's, the United States used to be China's primary rare earth\nsupplier.\nBut all that changed when the Chinese lowered their rare earth prices to cost\n- if not below - driving rare earth operations around the globe out of\nbusiness. Kind of a familiar \"China story,\" eh? Well, it applies here, with\nrare earths, as well.\nThe low prices out of China are why the Kyrgyzstan government, which I'll tell\nyou about in full depth below, shut down its rare earth operation a decade\nago.\nIt's also why rare earth mining came to a screeching halt here in the U.S.\nWith China undercutting the Americans on price at the same time the U.S. rare\nearths mine was facing heavy environmental regulation, it was forced to close.\nNow China's spent the past 15 years carefully\u2026 and brilliantly - you've got to\ngive them credit! - establishing itself as the world's ONLY producer of rare\nearth elements. The Chinese are now in the driver's seat on this one\u2026\nSo if China were to, possibly, tighten or threaten to cut off the supply of\nrare earths, a large part of the modern economy would be crippled. So would\nour military.\nWhoops! _As I speak, that's already happening\u2026_\nDid you see the news all through the fall of 2010, about how China was placing\nan embargo on rare earths exports to Japan and the West? Heck, the issue was\nimportant enough that President Obama, and Secretary of State Clinton,\ndiscussed the problem with their Chinese counterparts during trips to Asia.\nThink about this\u2026 Ten years ago China exported 75% of its production of rare\nearth metals to the rest of the world. Today it exports less than 25%, even\nthough the production in the last 10 years has more than doubled.\nBottom line: China's rare earth exports to the rest of the world will soon be\nreduced to ZERO. In fact, on December 28, 2010, China rocked the world markets\nby cutting its rare earths export quota by a staggering 35% for 2011.\n_So how soon could it be before China completely shuts off exports to the\nentire world?_\nThe Chinese domestic demand for rare earth metals is expected to surpass\nproduction around 2012.\nThat means in less than a year it could be impossible to manufacture products\nwith rare earths outside of China!\nThat's why the U.S. Department of Commerce warns, **\"A crisis point could be reached as early as the period 2012 to 2014.\"**\nThe U.S. Magnetic Materials Association says, **\"Chinese domestic consumption of rare earth materials is expected to surpass domestic production around 2012.\"**\nManufacturing & Technology News reports, **\"With growing global demand and China controlling 97% of the global market for mining rare earth metals, China could reach its production capacity by 2012.\"**\nBottom line: A worldwide shortage of \"technology metals\" is rapidly\napproaching!\nThat's why there's such an urgent global need to find new sources of rare\nearths outside China.\nAnd with a shortfall in supply looming and demand soaring, prices for rare\nearth metals have simply exploded\u2026\nWe're in a full-blown bull market for rare earths! Yeah, it's a problem. But\nit's also a huge opportunity for you.\nThere are simply NO substitutes!**\nGlobal demand for rare earths tipped the scales at 110,000 tons in 2010.\nGlobal demand for rare earths by 2015 is expected to be 250,000 tons. _That's\nmore than double!_\nWell, on that one, let's just say that it'll be an \"interesting\" time.\nDriving this demand are giant multi-billion dollar companies like General\nElectric, which uses rare earths in wind turbines, Toyota and Nissan for their\nhybrid and electric cars, and Research In Motion and Apple for their\nincreasing array of smartphones and tablets.\nAnd by 2025, global demand could be a jaw-dropping 2 MILLION TONS, including\nover 1.5 million tons applied in electric and hybrid vehicles!\nBy comparison, 2 MILLION TONS would be about 20 aircraft carriers made of pure\nrare earth metals.\nThe only thing that isn't growing is our supply.\nThat's why Senator Lisa Murkowski from Alaska says, \"Unless action is taken,\nwe will trade our dependence on foreign oil for an equally unsettling\ndependence on foreign minerals.\"\nBut it's just not that easy to resume full production\u2026 Not like turning on a\nswitch.\nGetting ore from rocks, and taking the many steps to turn it into the pure\nmetals needed for manufacturing involves highly sophisticated technology -\nand, sad to say, U.S. companies no longer have the know how or proper tools to\naccomplish this.\nWhat do I mean? _Well\u2026 The engineering knowledge and expertise have moved\noverseas\u2026_\nThat's why the National Mining Association says, \"When you stop mining in this\ncountry, as investment goes down, expertise on cutting-edge technologies is\nexported as well.\"\nPlus, the old processes from the U.S.'s heyday can't be used: They're now\neconomically and environmentally unsustainable - the old processes use all\nsorts of exotic acids and heat treatments.\nBottom line: It will be difficult, costly, and time-consuming to ramp up\nagain.\nThe **U.S. Department of Energy** says it takes 7 to 10 years to obtain\npermits to open a new rare earth mine in the U.S., the longest among the\ntop-25 mining countries.\nAnd a recent U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) review said it could\ntake up to 15 years for the U.S. to produce an adequate supply of its own and\nbreak its dependence on China.\nMake no mistake: governments and industries from all over the globe will\nfill the coffers of companies that secure long-term supplies of rare earths\nwith BILLIONS of investment dollars!**\nCompanies that have absolutely NOTHING to do with China.\n_That's why right now is the perfect time to be buying a few specific rare\nearth stocks\u2026_\nThe Most Explosive Rare Earth's Play on the Market - With Potential of\n8,577%!**\nThe first rare earth opportunity I'd like to share with you is explosive. When\nword hits Wall Street about this tiny Canadian company's giant $14 billion\ndiscovery of rare earths in the former Soviet Union, it's likely to send its\nstock price into the stratosphere!\nFact is, anytime you have a tiny company that's secured the rights to an\nestimated $14 billion rare metals find - some people should be getting rich.\nAnd today I want YOU to be one of them?\nBased on a 1996 estimate, the mine holds 20 MILLION TONS of \"technology\nmetals\"!\nJust this alone puts the penny stock's present value at $30 per share.\nThe bottom line is this\u2026 _at today's current share price\u2026 this tiny company is\nway underpriced._\nBut make no mistake: Wall Street will not ignore this situation for long\u2026\nYou could see gains of 8,577% off this stock once investors discover this\nlittle-known \"technology metals\" juggernaut.\nTurning a small stake of just $5,000 into $428,500 or $10,000 into $857,000\nstarting just days from now\u2026\n_And remember_ \u2026 this is just an estimate of this penny stock's value based on\nan initial finding from this monster \"technology metals\" discovery.\nSo without further ado, let's get started\u2026\nIf You Want to Invest in Rare Earths, You MUST Own Shares of this\nCompany\u2026**\nI found out about this opportunity in Hong Kong. I flew one of Delta's longest\nscheduled flights - direct from Detroit - up and almost over the North-\nfreezing-Pole (got as far as 81 degrees north), and then down across Siberia,\nMongolia and China to get there.\nWhy the long haul? Why travel so far? I was there to attend the Roskill\nInternational Rare Earths Conference. This is THE global conference for rare\nearths. One highly respected resource sector player told me, \"If you don't go\nto the Roskill conference, you aren't really in the rare earths business.\"\nAs with all world-class get-togethers, this conference has a bunch of\ninteresting talks and presentations on the agenda. But the real import of the\nmeeting is who is here. The list of attendees is pure gold. I was in the\ncompany of the key rare earths players in the world.\nThe Chinese were there, and as you know, they run the rare earths show, with\ntheir global market share of 97%. The big end-users were also there, from\nJapan and Korea. The North American players and developers too, along with the\nAustralians and the top people from Europe. Tickets were sold out.\nA Hidden Gem - And Your Best Chance for Rare Earth Profits\u2026**\nWhen I attended this conference I discovered a hidden gem of a company - and\ntrust me, this is a stock that has flown well under Wall Street's radar. So\nwithout further ado, let me introduce you to **Stans Energy (RUU: TSX-V).**\nStans trades on the Toronto Venture Exchange, and also on U.S. Pink Sheets. If\nat all possible, go for the Venture shares, because there's more float\n(meaning you'll get the most liquid, fairest price). Here in ESI, we'll track\nthe Venture shares, not the Pink Sheets.\nLike many Canadian resource plays, Stans is headquartered is in Toronto.\nUnlike most other publicly traded companies, the main action for Stans is in\nthe former Soviet Union.\nLet me address a question that probably just popped into your head. The former\nUSSR? Home of the old Gulag Archipelago? Isn't the former USSR a risky place\nto invest?\nYes and no. The USSR was, of course, Communist. That was then. But as you\nknow, Communism fell. So this is now. The numerous regions of the former USSR\nare a hodgepodge of developing nations. There's nothing easy about it. You're\nnot in Kansas anymore. You always have to know what you're doing.\nSo still, is the former USSR risky? Hey, if you don't know what you're doing,\nyes, it's very risky and you'll lose only your shirt if you're lucky.\nBut if you know what you're doing? If you've got your act together? Then the\nEurasian landmass is an emerging market that offers the prospect of phenomenal\nreturns.\nFortunately for us, I'm convinced that the people at Stans know what they're\ndoing, which is why I'm writing this article.\nThings Going Right for Stans**\nFirst and foremost, Stans holds rare earths assets in Kyrgyzstan, formerly\npart of the USSR but now an independent nation that's looking to grow and\ndevelop. The assets are spectacular, as I'll describe below.\nSecond, Stans has good - as in, _seriously good_ \\- relations with key players\nin Moscow, if you know what I mean. I'll discuss that some more, too.\nThird, Stans has tremendous support for what it's doing from the highest\nlevels of the Canadian government - with a former Canadian ambassador to\nRussia on its board of directors.\nAny more aces in the hole? I believe it's safe to say that Stans has an inside\ntrack to pick up its preference of any of up to 50 (no typo, 50) world-class\nrare earths deposits across the Eurasian landmass of the current Russian\nFederation.\nFabulous Assets!**\nSo here's the first big thing you need to know about Stans: It's rich in hard-\nrock rare earths resources. Wait, that's an understatement. When it comes to\nthe rock bodies and downstream assets, the word \"fabulous\" comes to mind - in\nits classical English sense. It's not overstating things to say that Stans is\na country mile ahead of the non-Chinese competition. There's Stans. Then\nthere's everybody else.\nLet me amplify that last comment. Over and above an outstanding series of\nconnected ore bodies, Stans holds the keys - literally - to a geostrategic ore\nand refining asset in Kyrgyzstan.\nOne critical asset has the practical, ex-Soviet name of Kutessay II. But don't\nlet the unsexy name bore you. Indeed, this mine in Kyrgyzstan holds a massive\n$14 BILLION reserve of rare earth metals and other strategic metals!\nThe Soviets built Kutessay II in Kyrgyzstan back during the Cold War. The\nplant processed ore from a nearby mine and produced materials for the Soviet\nnuclear energy and weapons program. The ore was (and still is) rich in heavy\nrare earths (HREs), especially dysprosium (Dy), europium (Eu) and terbium\n(Tb). Here's an illustration with the elemental breakdown:\nKutessay II Rees Historical Ore Distribution.\nToday, this kind of ore distribution is where the demand and big money is.\nHere's another illustration of the value chain, showing how certain of the\nelements command huge price markups:\nKutessay II Ore Distribution by Oxide Value USD - Avergage Price of REO/Kg =\n$57.75 (prices taken from www.asianmetals.com in July, 2010)\nThose Good Old Soviets\u2026**\nNow for some history. Let me say a few kind words about the old USSR.\nAs you may know, when it came to building atom bombs to defend the Motherland,\nthe Soviets spared no resource or expense.\nYou may or may not know that you need rare earths to build some kinds of\nnuclear weapons. Thus, during the Cold War, the Soviets built up Kutessay II\ninto a massive HRE refinery complex. Kutessay II comes complete with stainless\nsteel and titanium tanks, porcelain linings, glass piping, heavy-duty\nelectrical systems and so much more. Plus, there are roads, power lines,\nnatural gas, rail facilities, water, waste disposal facilities and maintenance\nshops. It's beyond gold-plated.\nKutessay II was a Soviet strategic state asset. The former Soviet Five-Year\nPlans lavished material resources and human talent on Kutessay II. Think in\nterms of a U.S. national laboratory, only with more people and more assets and\nlots more money. Plus, it was tightly guarded and well cared for over many\nyears.\nAfter the USSR fell, Kyrgyzstan gained independence. The Kutessay II plant\nremained in operation for about a decade, but without the Soviet-era level of\nresources. The plant finally closed about 10 years ago, in the face of bad\neconomics caused by low-priced Chinese output. It's the same thing that put\nall the other non-Chinese producers out of business across the world.\nStill, the successive Kyrgyz governments understood what they have. Through\nseveral different political eras, the Kyrgyzs protected the Kutessay II site.\nThe plant remains intact. It's not like people stripped it down and sold off\nparts for scrap.\nKutessay II needs plenty of maintenance, to be sure. But the point is that\nright now - today - the Kutessay II plant is the only fully built, non-Chinese\nHRE facility in the world. It has a history of past production. There's a\nlicense to dispose of nuclear-contaminated waste products (try obtaining such\na license in most Western countries!) And Stans owns a 25-year renewable\noperating license for the property. Lock, stock and barrel.\nPeople, People and People**\nYou're beginning to see why I like Stans, right? Even better, there are still\npeople around who remember how Kutessay II all works.\nIt gets back to that old saying about \"people, people and people.\" Many of the\nformer techs and engineers, the electricians and pipe fitters and so many more\nformer employees are still there. Heck, even the security guards are still\nhanging around. Most of them haven't died off or moved away. They've been\nwaiting, waiting, waiting for something to happen.\nNow along comes Stans, with money and a business plan to get the Kutessay II\nsite back up and running. Could it get better?\nWell, yes. It's better. The archives at Kutessay II hold a vast body of\ntechnical literature on operations, maintenance and metallurgy for turning ore\ninto finished product. This is all part of the legacy of the former USSR. I'm\ntalking about warehouses full of technical data, based on years of operations.\nIt's the entire Soviet-era learning curve, available for the cost of turning\non the lights at the library.\nCompare Stans to the Other Players**\nWhat a story, eh? Stans has control over the HRE mine. It's working on the\nmill side of things, although the old Soviet-era mill is not as critical as\nKutessay II HRE refinery, which is already under contract. There are trained\npeople to do the work and mentor a younger generation that wants to work\nthere. And there's technical literature to support operations for producing\nHRE materials.\nThink about what this means to the non-Chinese rare earths business. Stans is\nthat proverbial \"first mover\" in a breakaway business. All while other non-\nChinese companies talk about the mills and plants they're \"going to build.\"\nStans controls a working mine and has the Kutessay II refinery. This is a\nplant with a history of running ore and producing HRE materials. The refinery\nat Kutessay II is built. It's there. It's on the map.\nSure, after many years of sitting idle, Kutessay II needs work, including a\nlot of fixing up. But for, say, $100 million, the Kutessay II facility will be\ncranking out HRE materials - sooner, not later - compared that to the half a\nbillion or billion dollars that new construction costs. It makes Stans that\nmuch more attractive. That's why Stans is beyond rich in further development\npotential. The upside is stellar.\nWho's Going to Make It?**\nLet me beat this drum some more. Let me state this point another way. There\nare a slew of new non-Chinese rare earths players out in investment-land.\nThere are, perhaps, 200 publicly traded \"rare earths\" companies out there.\nThere's even an exchange-traded fund (ETF) for rare earths, except you're\nlikely to be trading the bubble, not the fundamentals.\nOf those 200 plays, I'd say that there are about 15-20 companies that have\neven a fighting chance of turning their asset into something worthwhile in the\nnext 10 years. That's if many of them roll up with each other and form\nstrategic alliances with third parties that are major end-users. And if the\nU.S. government and governments in Japan, Australia, Canada and the European\nUnion really get behind the efforts and offer political and regulatory support\n- let alone tax breaks and/or direct funding.\nSo of those 15-20 companies I just indicated, there's room for perhaps four-\nsix rare earths refinery complexes outside of China. It depends on lots of\nthings we cannot control, from future demand to Chinese supply to government\nsubsidies.\nStaring Down the Barrels**\nThe best of the rare earths development players, with the best assets and the\nbest management teams, are all living with the same issue. They're staring\ndown the double barrels of the time-and-money shotgun.\nThat is, the BEST of them are mulling over the very unpleasant prospect of\nspending billions of dollars, and many years, on feasibility studies,\nengineering studies, permitting, construction, training, pilot processing and\ndebugging operations. Then, MAYBE they'll have a rare earths end product to\nsell, in head-to-head competition with the Chinese. You want risk? You've got\nrisk!\nNo Vaporware**\nBut with Stans? No vaporware here. This is not just another company making an\narm-waving presentation in front of a geologic map with the promoter talking\nabout how promising are the \"geophysical indications\" and \"mineralized\nanomalies.\" Nope.\nWith Stans, you're getting the real McCoy. Stans has the Right Stuff. Stans\nhas real rocks, a real mine, a real processing plant, real technical people\nand - most importantly - unduplicable sets of real relationships with the\nright people in the right places.\nThe Right People**\nOn that last point, let me just say that the list of Russian and Kyrgyz\nadvisers to Stans is a who's who of players from the former USSR and current\ngo-to folks in Russia and Kyrgyzstan.\nStans has close relationships with individuals who are members of the old\nSoviet Academy of Sciences, now the Russian Academy of Sciences. These people\nare on the speed-dial list for the likes of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. In\nmy research on rare earths, reading hundreds of papers and abstracts, I've\nseen many of the same Russian names over and over. These are \"the\" players,\nand they're working with Stans.\nFurthermore, there's a former Canadian ambassador to Russia working with\nStans. The diplomatic channels in all this are simply unparalleled. Here we\nhave the leadership of the world's largest nation - Russia - working with the\nleadership of the world's second-largest nation - Canada - to make things\nhappen.\nIt all gets back to that \"political risk\" issue. When you build the right\nrelationship - which is exactly what Stans has done - you derisk a lot of the\nrest of your effort. The entire project becomes more and more doable.\nWhere to From Here? Some Ideas\u2026**\nSo where is this project going? What is Stans going to do?\nHere are a few ideas, although I caution you that things are happening fast\nand are subject to change. The recent dust-up in the rare earths space has\ncompressed the next few years of developments into a time frame of a few\nmonths.\nOn a practical level, Stans management is working to nail down the final\nissues of getting the Kutessay II project up and running. I won't go into the\ndetails. I'll save that for a future discussion. Suffice it to say that Stans\nmanagement will burn many buckets of midnight oil in some pretty exotic\nplaces. They're earning their paychecks and building value for shareholders.\nWhen Kutessay II is ready to move back into operation - as soon as 12 months\nfrom now, I believe - funding will not be an issue. There's just too much\nmoney out there awaiting the opportunity to catch the first wave of non-\nChinese rare earths production. In fact, much of that money is from Japan and\nKorea - these were the guys attending the Roskill conference.\nAlong the way, the Kyrgyz government is very much on board with what Stans\nwants to do. There's strong support for the Kutessay II project.\nLikewise, the Russian government also appears to be on board. Think in terms\nof Russian strategic interests. Russia has a natural interest in what happens\nin Kyrgyzstan, which is part of what Russia considers its \"near abroad.\" Plus,\nRussian leadership is quite mindful of the technical, economic and strategic\nmerits of Kyrgyz HRE output. The Russians do NOT want this deal to fall into\nthe hands of the Chinese and are more than happy to let the Canadians take the\nlead.\nMore specifically, there are many Russians who want to see the Kutessay II\nrefinery - a former Soviet state strategic asset - back up and running. I\nbelieve that one key booster is Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, who hopes\nto create a Russian version of Silicon Valley.\nThat is, if a Russian Silicon Valley is going to happen, Russia will need its\nown assured supplies of high-tech metals, particularly HREs. So look for a\nfavorable HRE off-take agreement toward Russia and watch Russia become an HRE\nplayer in the world.\nHere's one other point for you to consider about Stans. In Russia, there are\n50 or so known rare earths deposits, some of which are unbelievably massive.\nI'll discuss this more in future articles, but all across Russia are sites\nthat the Soviets discovered and did not develop. The Soviets needed the output\nfrom just Kutessay II. That was sufficient for the Soviets, and thus they\nnever developed the other sites.\nSo now Stans is in a position to obtain mining and extraction rights in many\nother prospective locales. When that happens - which will take a longer time\nto play out, to be sure \\- the idea will be to put the ore on a train, and\nhaul it to you-know-where, in Kyrgyzstan.\nThus over time can Stans become an even more dominant player in the rare\nearths space using Russian ore.\nThe Disruptive Force in the Rare Earths Space**\nStans Energy has been working for several years behind the cloak of the former\nUSSR. There was not a lot of visibility. Stans was \"too risky\" for a lot of\npeople.\nBut this year I expect that Stans is going to decloak and announce that it's\nready to restart Kutessay II, refining HRE materials. This will put Stans out\nin front of everybody and, in my view, seriously disrupt all the other\ninvestment plans of the rest of the rare earths players.\nWhat happens when Stans nails down its plans to take out Russian ore, refine\nit at Kutessay II and send it back to Russia (or Japan or Korea)? That'll be a\nmajor disruptive blast to the rare earths space.\nBuying Stans**\nRight now, Stans has about 132 million shares outstanding trading. The share\nprice has risen significantly in the past month or so, and the trend is\nupward.\nMost shares of Stans are closely held by people who understand the rare earths\nstory very well, and they are not selling. Thus, on any given day, there are\nabout 25 million shares that actually trade. As more and more people learn the\nStans story, fewer and fewer of them want to sell.\nWill Stans eventually get bought out? Doubtless, yes. But it'll have to be\nvery friendly, and very good for the shareholders. There's too much at stake\nfor someone just to swoop in and try a raw takeover. The personal\nrelationships in Russia and Kyrgyzstan are critical.\nSo get your shares of Stans, and get them soon. Buy judiciously. Buy on down\ndays. Watch the chart. Buy at your best opportunity. But get some shares. Buy\nand hold. Do NOT trade out. If you sell, you'll likely have to pay more when\nyou want to buy back in. This story is unfolding, and unfolding fast.\nIf you're interested in this idea, I recommend paying no more than $2 to get\ninto Stans Energy. Don't chase the stock higher and higher.\nRemember, I expect the market to catch on within a matter of weeks or months.\nAlso, we're probably going a lot of positive press in the near future.\nWatch the stock, buy carefully and build your position over time.\nAgain, right now, $2 is my recommended ceiling on this one. You should have\nmore than enough opportunity to get in below that price in the coming weeks.\nAction to take: Use a strict limit order to buy Stans Energy (RUU: TSX-V) up\nto $2.00.**\nYour 2nd Chance to Grab Rare Earth Profits** **:\nThe Rare Earth Company Down Under - Set to Profit from the China Squeeze\u2026**\nOkay so by now you know the story. China controls 97% of the output of rare\nearths and the industrial world is scrambling to find suppliers. This leads\ndirectly to your next opportunity to profit.\nLet me introduce you to **Lynas Corp. Ltd. (LYC: ASX)** with headquarters in\nSydney, Australia. Lynas trades on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).\nLynas has remarkable potential going forward.\nLynas controls the Mount Weld carbonatite in Western Australia. Mount Weld is\na world-class ore body and, indeed, one of the largest rare earth deposits\never discovered. Lynas has all necessary permits to proceed with mining\noperations to recover rare earths.\nIn fact, Lynas has been moving ore since July 2007 and stockpiling it while\nthe processing facilities are being constructed - talk about forward thinking!\nAlmost all of this ore has been sold or is under contract. One of the largest\ncustomers is French chemical giant Rhodia.\nLynas has two other Australian prospects also, the Crown polymetallic resource\nand another rare earth deposit in Malawi. Currently, Lynas is performing\nearly-stage efforts and due diligence, including assessment drilling.\nThese deposits have good potential downstream. In short, Lynas has a rich\nseries of ores in its development pipeline, in the arenas of both rare earths\nand other important elements.\nBased on its efforts at Mount Weld, Lynas has developed its own proprietary\nRED (Rare Earths Direct) brand. All rare earth products marketed by Lynas will\nbear the RED brand.\nThe aim is to make RED a global benchmark for quality and continuity of\nsupply, because much of the current Chinese output comes in varying levels of\nquality (see below). And the trend within the global industry is that raw,\nprimary rare earth ores are gradually being replaced by more refined chemical\nproducts that are purer and closer to the end-use state.\nLynas has developed proprietary technology for separating the rare earth\nelements from the mined ore and upgrading the final product to a high standard\nthat will command a premium price. And Lynas has already signed several long-\nterm supply contracts with overseas users.\nThe contracts have price floors and relatively open-ended escalation clauses.\nThis will protect Lynas from any unanticipated declines in market prices and\nallow the firm to capture most of the premium from future price increases.\nLynas will process the minerals from Mount Weld near the mine, with additional\nprocessing and refining planned for a new, state-of-the-art facility site in\nKemaman, on the east coast of Malaysia.\nWhen it's up and running, this facility will be one of the worlds only high\ncapacity rare earth processing facility outside of China.\nThe Kemaman facility is located near large-scale sources of power and other\ninfrastructure, including a skilled work force. The Malaysian government\noffers a solid degree of political stability and is highly supportive of the\nLynas project.\nManagements goal is to have ore running through the processing facility in\nless than 24 months. This is a solid goal, and could mean substantial gains\nfor early investors.\nLynas Offers a Great Chance to Profit from the China Rare Earth Squeeze**\nLynas plans to exploit a number of features within the Chinese rare earth\nindustry that are turning into long-term strategic weaknesses. First, the\nChinese government is clearly increasing control over the nation's rare earth\nindustry and tightening supply in order to cause prices to rise. This has\ndampened some of the local Chinese entrepreneurial spirit, and replaced it\nwith a lethargic and bureaucratic approach to operations and problem solving.\nSecond, the Chinese government has imposed mining quotas and placed\nrestrictions on both rare earth output and exports. Some of the restrictions\nare due to enforcing Chinese environmental laws (lax as they are), which has\ncaused numerous smaller operations to close shop. Other restrictions have to\ndo with China's industrial policy to favor the establishment of industry that\nuses rare earths within China. In other words, China has allocated much of its\nfuture rare earth production to internal users. By default, there is less rare\nearth product available for export despite overseas price signals.\nAt the same time, China is approaching its own limits on the output of rare\nearths for both geological and technical reasons. China's largest rare earth\nmine, at Baotou, is running at full capacity and cannot increase output. And\nas mining in China reaches the limits of some of the ore bodies, the quality\nof China's rare earth products has been quite variable.\nIt does not help that Chinese rare earth enterprises are obsessed with low-\ncost production techniques that work against improving quality for the final\nproduct.\nSo the bottom line is that Lynas is turning into the global alternative to\npurchasing rare earths from China. Along with Stans Energy it represents a\nlegitimate way to profit from the rare earths run-up.\nAs world rare earth demand skyrockets, Lynas is going to make some serious\nmoney out of this - and now's your chance to join them!\nAction to take: Buy shares of Lynas Corp. Ltd. (LYC: ASX). Note: Lynas Corp.\ntrades on the Australian Securities Exchange.**\nYour 3rd Chance to Grab Rare Earth Profits** **:\nProfit from a \"Heavyweight\" Rare Earth Exploration Company - Right Here in the\nU.S.!**\nNow that I've explained the basics of rare earths, it's time to throw more\nopportunities into the investment ball-and-rod mill. Because there are really\ntwo kinds of rare earths. In fact, there are two entirely different markets\nfor rare earths.\nThere are the \"light\" and \"heavy\" rare earths. The distinction is based on the\natomic numbers of the elements (see numbers below the chemical symbols in the\nimage below).\nThe light rare earths range from lanthanum (La) to gadolinium (Gd). Then, with\nsome overlap, the heavy rare earths range from samarium (Sm) to lutetium (Lu).\nAs I mentioned, samarium, europium and gadolinium are viewed as falling in\nboth camps.\nLight rare earths are fairly abundant in terms of volumes. The market drivers\nfor the light elements are mostly in the field of magnets. Think in terms of\nneodymium, going into those big windmill magnets to the tune of 500 pounds\neach.\nHeavy rare earths are far less abundant in terms of volumes. The market\ndrivers for heavy rare earths are more in electronics. Think in terms of a\nfraction of an ounce of material going into the chips and other electronic\ncircuitry in your cell phone or in a small medical device.\nThe chemical distinctions, let alone the market forces, are pretty hairy\nwithin the industry. What it means to us as investors, however, is that we\nneed to look for companies with ore bodies that are rich in heavy rare earths.\nFor all of their respective virtues, Lynas and U.S. based Molycorp have lots\nof light rare earths and not so much in the way of heavy rare earths.\nSo is there is a company out there with control over heavy rare earth bodies?\nI'm glad you asked, because yes, there is - the company is **Ucore Rare Metals\n(UCU: TSX-V).**\nProfit from this \"Heavyweight\" Rare Earth Explorer**\nUcore Rare Metals is an exploration company. Its flagship property is at Bokan\nMountain, Alaska.\nUcore shares trade on the Toronto Venture Exchange. The company used to be\ncalled \"Ucore Uranium,\" but management recently changed the name. Why? The\nBokan Mountain, Alaska, claim is the site of a prolific former uranium mine\nfrom the Cold War. Thing is, the uranium mine also holds large amounts of rare\nearths, including heavy rare earths.\nIndeed, the old uranium mine is what makes this new rare earths play so\nintriguing. If Ucore controlled a hunk of undeveloped rock out in the middle\nof the Alaska forest, I might not be interested. But Ucore controls a set of\nclaims with serious mining development and infrastructure already in place.\nSo why change the name? Management wanted to move attention away from the\nuranium side of things and focus more on the rare earths in the portfolio.\nFair enough.\nAn Amazing Find, Hidden Right in Our Own Back Yard\u2026**\nJust as the Molycorp Mountain Pass site was discovered by uranium prospectors\nlooking for ore, so goes the history of Bokan Mountain. Back in 1955, a couple\nof prospectors were flying over Prince of Wales Island in a Piper Cub\nairplane. They were towing a \"Nucliometer\" behind them, a souped-up Geiger\ncounter device that measures radioactivity.\nWhen the prospectors crossed over Bokan Mountain, in the midst of the Tongass\nNational Forest, the nuclear readings began to go through the roof. These\nprospectors knew that they had found something, and in those days it meant\nthat the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) moved in fast to exploit the resource.\nBy 1957, there was a permitted uranium mine up and running. Since it was all\nhappening in the Tongass National Forest, there were few human beings to get\nin the way, protest or otherwise interfere with things. Between 1957-71, the\nMt. Bokan site became home to the Ross-Adams Mine, which produced over 1.3\nmillion pounds of uranium yellowcake.\nTo produce that amount of product, the mining firm built out an extensive\nsystem of heavy-duty mining roads, along with a pier facility. It's all still\nthere, southwest across the water from today's fishing and cruise ship port of\nKetchikan, Alaska.\nThe uranium mine closed in 1971, and nothing much else happened for quite a\nwhile. There was a modest amount of regional geological work in the 1970s and\n1980s by the U.S. Bureau of Mines.\nGeological Studies**\nOn a broad scale, in the 1980s, the geological community figured out that\nPrince of Wales Island is part of what's called the \"Alexander terrane\" of\nAlaska. \"Terrane\" is a plate tectonics concept. It means that the rock bodies\nwe're looking at formed far to the south, and in Cretaceous time were\ntransported north, to collide with the North American continent.\nAlaskan geology is very complex, and the terrane concept adds to the\ndifficulty of deciphering the past. What we're left with, in this Mount Bokan\narea, is a wide variety of exotic mineral deposits - really, it's years beyond\nthe stuff you learn in Geology 101. It's much more like a graduate-level\ncourse in mineralogy and geochemistry. The bottom line is that, when people\nlooked closely, they determined that Mount Bokan is unusually rich in the\nheavy rare earths.\nThe rare earths are mostly hosted in volcanic rocks called andesite, via\ncoarse-grained pegmatites that form intrusive dikes around Mount Bokan. Thus,\nthere are strong structural controls that make exploration more systematic.\nThe original magmas probably came from deep within the volatile and rich upper\nmantle and cooled from molten rocks that originated in the deep crust. So when\nI say \"rare\" earths, I mean really rare minerals.\nAt Mount Bokan, rare earths mineralization is associated with elevated\nuranium, as well as thorium levels. This makes radiometric surveys very\nsuccessful in identifying new sites of rare earths mineralization.\nIn the late 1980s, the U.S. Geological Survey published an eye-catching\nestimate of rare earths resources: nearly 374 million pounds of combined\nyttrium and rare earths oxide (note that it's NOT compliant with current rules\nfor Canadian National Instrument 43-101). Still, the rough U.S. government\nwork indicated that in addition to its proven uranium resource, Mount Bokan\nmay be among the largest heavy rare earths deposits in the U.S.\nWhere to Go From Here?**\nIn 2006, Ucore Uranium acquired the claim. Now Ucore is in the driver's seat,\nwith no title issues.\nJust with uranium alone, Ucore may be sitting on top of over 11 million pounds\nof potential yellowcake. As for the rare earths, there's no solid estimate\nyet, because the company is in the midst of a drilling and assaying program.\nThere's a fair degree of certainty, however, that there's something\nsignificant out there at Mount Bokan. But as with many old sites, the area\nhasn't ever been systematically or comprehensively explored with modern\nchemical and geophysical techniques and technologies. Really, there's been no\nsignificant mining or capital investment there for almost 40 years.\nStill, we know that there's a proven ore body at Mount Bokan, with uranium and\nrare earths that have been identified and investigated to some extent. Plus,\nthere's an extensive historical database containing previous exploration and\nmining data.\nJust from the first pass of new exploration and assaying, there are multiple\nprospects and multiple ore commodities at Mount Bokan, of both uranium and\nrare earths. The place has existing infrastructure and improvements, which\nleads to near-term production potential. And it's located in a part of Alaska\nthat's mining friendly. That is, this former mine site is specifically set\naside for resource development and there are no residential or indigenous\npopulations in proximity.\nThe Ucore Story**\nUcore has some very good people on its management and technical team, so right\naway it's got a leg up. Take this great ore body in a known mining district\nwith historical production. Add a group of people who know what they're doing.\nAnd where can this company go? In a world where rare earths are about to\nbecome hot commodities, Ucore could be a great upstream play.\nWhat are the risks? You mean, aside from being a rare earths play, and all the\nother issues I've discussed before with other companies? I'd like to see Ucore\nmore cashed up, but that probably means diluting the current shareholders. I'd\nalso like to see any new cash go for faster progress with drilling results and\nassays. Right now, I'm not entirely sure that the company has the financial\ndepth to do everything it'll take to make the Mount Bokan program work.\nSo why look at Ucore? Because of the ore body. Because of the mining history.\nBecause of location, location and location. Because in the coming rare earths\ncrunch, I can see Ucore teaming up with a larger, better-capitalized firm.\nMeanwhile, I believe that Ucore has a good rare earths story to tell and it\ncan keep delivering good results until the right partner comes along.\nDon't chase this stock. But accumulate a position. Get on board. Something\ngood ought to come down the road, and sooner, rather than later.\nAction to take: Buy Ucore Rare Metals (UCU: TSX-V).**\nStay Tuned for Future Updates On these Rare Earth Companies and Fresh New\nProfit Opportunities\u2026**\nI'll be consistently monitoring the companies listed in this report and\nstaying on top of any new information.

This also would result in a higher resettlement rate than the one for Syrians right now.\nBush\u2019s 2004 number of 12,814 will be dwarfed if Donald Trump doesn\u2019t follow through on his campaign promise to halt the flow of refugees from terror-producing parts of the world.\nVirtually all Somalis are Muslims and very few come in to US outside of the Refugee Admissions Program. Although some do come illegally across our borders and then apply for asylum.\nHere is the map of where they went (again these are the numbers for October 1, 2016 to December 10, 2016). This is the number for resettled refugees only:\nHere are the top ten states in which they were placed.

        "text": "On Monday, members of the Electoral College will cast their historic votes for the next president of the United States. In the meantime, they are under siege.\nThe nation\u2019s 538 presidential electors have been thrust into the political foreground like never before in American history. In the aftermath of a uniquely polarizing presidential contest, the once-anonymous electors are squarely in the spotlight, targeted by death threats, harassing phone calls and reams of hate mail. One Texas Republican elector said he\u2019s been bombarded with more than 200,000 emails.\nStory Continued Below\n\u201cI never can imagine harassing people like this. It\u2019s just f----- up,\u201d said Jim Rhoades, a Republican elector from Michigan who runs a home inspection service. \u201cI\u2019ve lost a bunch of business.\u201d\nIn recent decades, the Electoral College had become such a reliable rubber stamp of Election Day results that it was viewed as an afterthought.\nBut with many Democrats desperate to block the all-but-certain ascension of Donald Trump to the White House, this long-neglected body has been gripped by turmoil, and its members have been subjected to pleas to upend centuries of tradition by casting their votes for someone other than the president-elect.\nThere have been ad campaigns targeting electors and op-eds assailing their role. One Democratic member of Congress has called to delay the vote for president while an investigation of Russian involvement in the election is underway. Two others have pleaded with electors to consider Russia\u2019s role when deciding how to vote. Progressive groups are preparing protests across the country at sites where electors will meet to cast their ballots. Personal contact information for many electors has been posted publicly \u2014 and it\u2019s been used to bury them with massive email campaigns.\nADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads\nLast week saw the release of a video of celebrities like Martin Sheen pleading with Republican electors to vote for someone other than Trump. On Saturday, Unite for America \u2014 the group behind the video \u2014 began sending personalized versions to electors in which Sheen and more than a dozen others call them out by name.\nThe body\u2019s 306 Republicans have faced the most acute pressure of all. Several, like Rhoades, told POLITICO they receive thousands of emails a day from anti-Trump advocates, much of it auto-generated from forms available online. Others say they\u2019re receiving pressure from national Republicans and the Trump campaign to make sure they remain loyal.\nIn this Dec. 12 photo, Hector Maldonado poses in St. Louis. Although pestered to abandon Donald Trump, Republican electors appear to be in no mood for an insurrection in the presidential campaign'\u0092s last voting ritual. Maldonado backed Ted Cruz in the primaries but will cast his vote for Trump with conviction. \"\u0093I took an oath once to become a U.S. citizen,\u0094\" he said, \u0093\"and on Aug. 14, 1995, that was the first oath that I've taken to support the U.S. Constitution. A year later I took the oath again, to support the duties of being an officer in the U.S. Army. This was the third oath that I've taken to execute what I promised to do.\" | AP Photo\n\u201cThe Trump campaign is calling. The Republican Party of Texas is calling. They\u2019re trying to lock down the votes,\u201d said Texas GOP elector Alexander Kim, who estimated he has received at least 30 such calls. One RNC insider, he said, called him three times in one hour to get a response.\nThere\u2019s a reason electors like Kim make Republicans nervous. While he insists he\u2019s voting for Trump when the body meets on Monday and that nothing can shake him from that position, there is a caveat: \u201cunless Trump does something to violate the compact that he created with American citizens.\u201d\nJust that eyelash of doubt, Kim suspects, has led to his barrage of calls from the party.\nThe tumultuous 2016 primary campaign is in part responsible for the manic lobbying efforts. Dozens of electors have some degree of hostility to Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, both of whom won their party nominations after contentious primaries. Most of the Republican electors have since vowed to support Trump, but their presence has fueled the Democratic resistance and given it hope.\nIn this image from video, Electoral College voter Jim Skaggs looks through his mail from people writing him about being an elector in Bowling Green, Ky., on Dec. 13. Although pestered to abandon Donald Trump, Republican electors appear to be in no mood for an insurrection in the presidential campaign\u0092's last voting ritual. \"I hope he is far better than I think he is,\u0094\" Skaggs said. \"Even so, \u0093I fully intend to vote for Donald Trump,\" he said. \u0093\"I think it\u0092's a duty.\" | AP Photo\nChris Suprun of Texas, the only GOP elector to publicly oppose Trump, has been especially battered by criticism \u2014 mainly from fellow Republicans, including party leaders who have questioned his integrity.\nSuprun announced his intention to vote for someone other than Trump in a New York Times op-ed, recalling his service on Sept. 11, 2001, as a first responder to the attack on the Pentagon. On Friday, a Texas television station ran a story accusing Suprun of inventing his 9/11 role, the story that Suprun built his career around. The charge, based on a discrepancy with Suprun\u2019s LinkedIn page, featured an anonymous former colleague accusing Suprun of \u201cstolen valor.\u201d\nSuprun has vehemently denied the story.\nSuprun is the only Republican in a coalition of 10 electors who have launched a desperate, long-shot effort to convince GOP electors to reject Trump. They need at least 36 more to join them in order to prevent Trump from earning enough support to be officially elected president. If they were to succeed, the election would be thrown to the GOP-controlled House of Representatives for a final vote.\nRex Teter poses at his home in Pasadena, Texas, on Dec. 13. Teter, 59, a music teacher and preacher, received about 35,000 emails and 200 letters urging him not to support Donald Trump. It took him several hours to delete them the day after Thanksgiving. A Marco Rubio supporter in the primaries, he is solidly for Trump. \"Some have been very personal letters. Some threatening. One was very funny. They view President-elect Trump as a threat so it'\u0092s personal for them and I can empathize. But I'm not changing my vote as an elector.\" | AP Photo\nSuprun is also the only Republican who joined 79 Democratic electors in calling for an intelligence briefing on Russia\u2019s role in the election ahead of Monday\u2019s vote. The effort, spearheaded by California Democratic elector Christine Pelosi \u2014 daughter of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi \u2014 was rebuffed Friday by Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.\n\"Recently, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has received requests from Members of Congress, several electors of the Electoral College and the general public for additional information on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election,\" Clapper\u2019s office said in a statement, noting that President Barack Obama has called for a full review of Russian interference amid reports that President Vladimir Putin directed a hacking campaign aimed at Democrats in order to aid Trump\u2019s election. \"Once the review is complete in the coming weeks, the intelligence community stands ready to brief Congress and will make those findings available to the public consistent with protecting intelligence sources and methods.\u201d",

        "text": "The Friday Cover Read more\nThe industrial sector of Layramun in northwest Aleppo tells the story of this war. Its 1,200 factories have been looted and destroyed. In their place are piles of concrete rubble filled with rusted metal. Collapsed water tanks peak through the ruins. Where bustling factories and the din of machines once churned out bundles of yarn, only the occasional explosion of distant artillery can be heard. In the weeks since I visited the besieged city in early November, the Syrian military along with its foreign backers and proxies have staged a massive offensive that is imminently close to retaking the eastern half of Aleppo held by rebels for more than four years. Relentless air strikes have driven some 20,000 civilians to flee the ravaged industrial city, Syria\u2019s second largest.\n\u201cSixty percent of the companies here were textiles, like sewing. But we also had companies which made plastic and steel moldings,\u201d explained Ziyad Berri, an owner of a pharmaceutical company located in rebel territory.\nStory Continued Below\nBerri was one of a handful of industrialists and public figures who accompanied me and a dozen American and British journalists during our four-day trip inside a city that has dominated headlines for months but which few Western reporters have seen. What we saw, along with the devastation wrought by years of civil war, was evidence of how the Assad regime has maintained control over its most prosperous areas and why the rebels failed at capturing not only the city but the entire country. Though he waged an unpitying counterinsurgency campaign that has contributed to the deaths of 430,000, displaced half of his country\u2019s population and leveled vast swaths of Syria\u2019s major cities, President Bashar al-Assad managed to maintain the allegiance of a good portion of his citizens by offering them a thin veneer of normalcy.\nFor others, such as Aleppo\u2019s industrialists, Assad bet smartly on the knowledge that most of their fortunes s are tied to his survival and prosperity. Some of them made their money from their contacts with the all-powerful intelligence services that control the country and well-placed civil servants who can navigate the complex bureaucracy. Others were cognizant that a revolution is never kind to the wealthy. When the Ba\u2019ath took power in 1963, it nationalized factories and banks and imposed land reforms that severely restricted private holdings. Overnight, fortunes extending back centuries were wiped out.\nIt was not only the businessmen\u2019s wealth the rebels threatened, but their lifestyles as well. The Syrian rebellion in Aleppo was launched by the rural classes. They \u201ccame from Idlib and rural Aleppo,\u201d parliamentarian Zayna Khawla told me, speaking in a contemptuous tone, as if the rebels were the Beverly Hillbillies descending on Rodeo Drive. \u201cThey are not like us,\u201d industrialist Raf\u2019at Shammeh explained. \u201cTheir values are different. We want to protect our country. They want to destroy it.\u201d\n\u201cThis is commercial terrorism,\u201d our host Fares al-Shehabi noted. His position as Chairman of the Chamber of Industry gave him an aura of gravitas. But in Syria, where titles and positions mean nothing, it is proximity to the halls of power that matter. Shehabi\u2019s real influence derives from his late uncle who was the military chief of staff for 24 years. Shehabi showed us sacks filled with a substance he claimed was yellow sulfur used to make mortars. It was impossible to tell. The Chinese produced sacks were labeled dicalcium phosphate and titanium dioxide, two non-flammable substances.\nWhat was certain was that the narrative our government hosts spun us was only partially true. The rebels undoubtedly looted Layramun\u2019s factories, stripping them of everything that could be moved to Turkey, where industrialists have been scooping up equipment at fire-sale prices. Indeed, during a 2012 visit to Aleppo\u2019s most modern industrial complex, Sheikh Najjar, I saw rebels carting off heavy machinery.\nBut the rebels lack the artillery to pancake buildings. That is the work of the Syrian and Russian forces, who have only stepped up airstrikes since the beginning of the recent offensive. I stopped two of our military escorts, pointing to a building that had obviously been destroyed by airstrikes. I asked if government fighter jets had demolished it. One of the escorts studied the building\u2019s collapsed floors and was about to nod his head before his comrade blurted out \u201cgas canister bomb,\u201d a projectile popular with the rebels. The pensive soldier abruptly froze and agreed. In Syria, there are no prizes for critical thinking or dissent.\nOur Syrian hosts told us that the two dozen soldiers and another five or so plain clothes intelligence officers who accompanied us everywhere were necessary to protect us from the mortars rebels fire indiscriminately at civilian areas. But the Iranian and Russian journalists I saw close to the front lines did not merit the same VIP escort. Later, when I told one of my minders at the hotel that I wanted to go across the street to buy water at a kiosk, he demurred, urging me to return to my room. Minutes later, a hotel staffer brought me a frosty bottle. I was not sure whether to feel like a king in his castle or a prisoner in his dungeon.\n***\nThe medieval stalls of the Old City where Venetian traders established the first European consulate in 1548 have been reduced to charred stone. Minarets still stand, but their pockmarked bricks tell the story of the quarter\u2019s suffering. \u201cWe only used light weapons because to use heavy ones here would destroy our national treasures,\u201d Colonel Abd al-Majid told me. There\u2019s little evidence of such restraint. Outside observers have blamed both sides for the destruction that has obliterated pre-modern travelers\u2019 inns, religious seminaries and mausoleums.\nNearby lay the remains of the Carlton Hotel housed in a 19th century building. The rebels destroyed it in May 2014, tunneling several miles to plant underground explosives. An estimated 30 to 50 government forces were killed. The day before our visit to the Old City, Presbyterian Reverend Ibrahim Nseir told us how the rebels destroyed his church in 2012 using the same kind of munitions. Such tunnel bombs have proved to be one of the rebels\u2019 most effective weapons in an asymmetrical war in which they face daily air bombardments.\nAs I came out of the Suq al-Zarb near the Citadel, I glimpsed a stocky man with light skin and ruddy cheeks leaving a battle front area escorted by six Syrian soldiers. His gold necklace hinted that he was a foreigner. When one of our hosts told his retinue, \u201cGet him out of here!\u201d I understood he was a Russian. Another Russian in our group caught up with him, learning that he was from a base in the province of Samara on the Volga river. The soldier was likely from the city of Tolyatti which houses the 3rd Guards Special Forces Brigade, a contingent that has fought in Chechnya and Ukraine and is counted among Russia\u2019s elite forces. Moscow has repeatedly denied that its ground forces are fighting the rebels and instead argued that they are only battling the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). But the soldier\u2019s presence in Aleppo confirmed that Russia is willing to exhaust all its resources to prop up Assad.\nAn eclectic group of foreigners are certainly keeping Assad in power even as he remonstrates against the foreign jihadists destroying his country. But Assad refuses to acknowledge the contribution they have made to keep him in power.\nWhen I met with Assad days earlier, he posited, \u201cLet\u2019s suppose that these allegations are correct, and this president was killing his own people and committed crimes\u2026after five years and a half, who supported me?\u201d From my brief visit to Aleppo, it was clear that it was not Syria\u2019s silent majority. On the journey to the city, I saw a Hezbollah funeral procession outside Homs. In Aleppo, Kurdish fighters from the People\u2019s Protection Units held positions in Bani Zayd, a neighborhood which houses no Kurds. Iranian backed Shi\u2019i militias actively post their exploits on social media. And though the skies were quiet during my visit, Russian fighter jets have been pummeling rebel held areas of east Aleppo for months. Assad is winning this war because his backers have zealously embraced the use of overwhelming force while his adversaries, and their supporters, have not.\nBut it is Assad\u2019s people who are losing the war. Nearly 11 million Syrians have either fled the country or are internally displaced according to the United Nations. With a pre-war population of 21 million, that means about half have left their homes. In February, the Syrian Centre for Policy Research estimated that 11.5 percent of the population had been killed or injured through 2015.\nThe government has survived a failed revolution because it provides what the rebels can never do\u2014a consistent wage and the promise of a modicum of governance. The regime deftly understood early on that it was necessary to preserve the fa\u00e7ade of normalcy. The fate of Libyan leader Mu\u2019amar al-Qadhafi provides a stark contrast. After Qadhafi lost the eastern half of his country in a matter of weeks in 2011, he severed rebel held areas from regime-held territory. He cut off the mobile telephone networks. He ceased providing government services there. Qadhafi was under attack and he ensured that all Libyans knew this.\nBut Assad drew from a different playbook. He continued paying government salaries to civil servants in rebel territory. Utilities such as electricity and water were only cut off in the most besieged of territories. And the government tried its hardest to make residents forget a war was raging outside their cities. Assad has certainly starved out his enemies (food shortages have been a way of life in places like Aleppo for years and shipments of emergency rations have even been intercepted in rebel enclaves such as Daraya outside of Damascus) in ways reminiscent of World War II. But Assad has justified it to his supporters and fence sitters as a necessary move to stomp out the foreign jihadists threatening their existence. While his critics in the West scoff at such claims they resonate among a population that looks around the Middle East and only sees chaos when governments are toppled in the name of freedom and democracy.\nThis explains why even some of the poorest, most beleaguered Syrians have not forsaken their leader and instead rail at the rebels, who claim to want to liberate them from a despot. At the Hafiz al-Assad mosque, internally displaced persons (IDPs) from rebel held east Aleppo were eager to tell us how wicked the fighters there are. \u201cBashar pays our monthly wages and utilities,\u201d 72-year-old Salah Yassin said, struggling to enunciate words between his missing teeth. \u201cThe terrorists took our money and didn\u2019t give us any food.\u201d\nTen-year-old Muhammad Nur came four months ago from Bab al-Nayrab, an impoverished neighborhood filled with shoulder high garbage for a mile the last time I visited in 2012. \u201cI stayed in the house because I was afraid of mortars and artillery,\u201d he said, explaining why he didn\u2019t play in the street. \u201cI was happy when I came here because the army protects us.\u201d\nWith the heavy intelligence and military contingent meandering around the complex, it was difficult to ascertain where pre-rehearsed pro-government slogans ended and real sentiments began. Most regurgitated the government line that the rebels came from abroad and were backed by Qatar and Saudi Arabia. But their denunciations of the rebels were noteworthy if only because they are from the same destitute classes. The IDPs living in cramped wooden containers were not the wealthy business moguls with their polished English and European cut clothes who dined with us in posh establishments. The IDPs\u2019 support of the government merely illustrates how maladroit the insurgents are and why their backers in the West were so woefully wrong in urging another intervention in the Muslim world.\nOur hosts did not have to do much to illustrate this. They merely took us to the al-Razi hospital to show us the rebels\u2019 handiwork. An ambulance brought in a soldier whose bland camouflage uniform was covered in dark red around his left ankle. A trickle of others brought in more soldiers, casualties of a rebel offensive in Halab al-Jadida, replete with two suicide bombers and a barrage of mortars. But soon civilians inundated the hospital as well.\nOne was Hazim Sharif, a 26-year-old doctor with a coin-sized hole full of shrapnel in the chest. When he was initially rushed to the emergency room, he was barely conscious, his eyes glazed over. His mother wailed, \u201cPlease do not cry for my son. Pray for the Messenger.\u201d When I next saw him behind the hospital, he was covered with a blue cloth in the back of an ambulance. The EMS technician lifted the covering. His eyes were closed. On an elevated curb adjacent to a hospital entrance, a woman was grieving the loss of her husband. Inside was a makeshift morgue and seven bodies of those who died in the attack. Taxis and civilian cars periodically appeared to ferret away the dead. \u201cThese are the moderate rebels the media talks about,\u201d al-Shehabi lectured me. \u201cThey don\u2019t distinguish between soldiers and civilians. They want to kill us all.\u201d\nThe next day we were taken to humanitarian crossings, frontline posts the government has opened to allow rebels and civilians to leave besieged east Aleppo. At the Bustan al-Qasr crossing, a canal and piles of rusted car chassis divided the two sides. A captain told us the crossing was first opened five months ago. Twelve civilians had crossed to the government side for medical care before they returned. Two fighters did as well. But on the day of our visit, the streets were empty.\nThe Castello road crossing was more of a carnival affair. Buses lined dirt mounds, ready to transport civilians to less imperiled locations. The government promised to relocate fighters to nearby Idlib where their position is much stronger. A dozen Russian soldiers from the Centre for Reconciliation beamed video from their drones to Moscow for Ministry of Defense press conferences. We waited for several hours, but just like at Bustan al-Qasr, no one dared venture out of east Aleppo. Either they were comfortable dodging fighter jets strikes as they waited out the siege with no food, or as is more likely, they were too afraid of the consequences of crossing into government territory. All we saw from the east side was a mortar which landed 200 hundred feet away.\nThe government, supported by Russian fighter jets and Iranian backed Shi\u2019i militias, is confident it can retake east Aleppo. But it has been slow to move into the remaining besieged areas which shelter between 5,000 to 15,000 rebels according to local activists and insurgent group leaders. Whether it can deploy the forces necessary to do so remains to be seen. But what is certain is that the pain of Aleppo\u2019s civilians will endure long after the last mortar falls. Sectarian enmity and distrust will complicate a rebuilding process that is already estimated at more than $260 billion. If Assad wins, most Western observers will attribute the triumph to his use of naked force. But it his reliance on primordial loyalties, a fear of post-revolutionary chaos and appeal to the self-interest of Aleppo\u2019s merchant class which will have been the real keys to his success. In the end it may well look like a victory that would have been better avoided.",

She always says that.\"\nHe added: \"I don't think she will go for a hard Brexit.\"\nLast week, the Commons voted to support the government's timetable for Brexit, with Mr Clarke the only Conservative MP opposing it.\n'Not compatible'\nMr Clarke urged the government to publish a White Paper, \"setting out a strategy on which all the cabinet are agreed\" before negotiations with the EU begin.\nMinisters have said they do not want to give away too much of their position in advance, arguing this could undermine the UK during the process.\nLast month, 60 Conservative MPs called for the UK to pull out of both the European single market and the customs union, which allows its members to trade without tariffs but imposes common duties on goods imported from outside the bloc.\nOne of them, Suella Fernandes, MP for Fareham, said: \"As was made clear in the referendum campaign, remaining in the EU's internal market like Norway, or in a customs union like Turkey, is not compatible with either of these commitments and doing so would frustrate the will of the electorate.\"\nIn June's referendum, 51.9% of voters chose to leave the EU, with 48.1% opting for the UK to remain a member.",

And in early December, the CIA said it concluded that Moscow had already interfered in the U.S. presidential election.\nIn any other year, either of these claims would probably have been astonishing, sensational, and even mind-blowing.\nNot in 2016.\nThis was the year such things became routine as the Kremlin took the gloves off in its nonkinetic guerrilla war against the West.\nIt was the year Russia's long-standing latent support for the xenophobic and Euroskeptic far right became manifest, open, and increasingly brazen.\nIt was the year cyberattacks moved beyond trolling and disruption and toward achieving specific political goals.\nIt was the year long-cultivated networks of influence across the West were activated.\nIt was the year the Kremlin expanded its disinformation campaign beyond Ukraine and the former Soviet space and aimed it at destabilizing the West itself.\nIt was the year Moscow turned Western democracy into a weapon -- against Western democracy.\nAnd most importantly, with the West suffering from one of its worst crises of confidence in generations, 2016 was the year Moscow began to see results.\nIt was the year of the perfect storm, when the Western angst and malaise from the 2008 financial crisis, the eurozone crisis, and the migrant crisis crested and dovetailed with a concerted Kremlin campaign to undermine Western institutions.\nAnd with the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom, with the election of Donald Trump in the United States, with one pro-Moscow candidate or another likely to win the presidency in France, and with antiestablishment populism on the rise throughout Europe, this perfect storm has produced a markedly more favorable environment for the goals of Vladimir Putin's autocratic regime.\nIt has left the independence of countries seeking to escape Moscow's orbit -- like Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova -- more precarious than at any moment since the Soviet collapse.\nLarry Diamond, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, wrote recently in The Atlantic that the Kremlin has launched \"an opportunistic but sophisticated campaign to sabotage democracy and bend it toward his interests, not just in some marginal, fragile places but at the very core of the liberal democratic order, Europe and the United States.\"\n\"We stand now at the most dangerous moment for liberal democracy since the end of World War II,\" Diamond added.\nAn Early Harbinger\nThe warnings that 2016 would be different came early, in January, when Moscow escalated its information war against the West with the infamous case of Lisa F. in Germany.\nBy relentlessly pushing a false story that an ethnic-Russian teenage girl was sexually assaulted by migrants in Berlin at a time when Germans were getting increasingly nervous about the mounting migrant crisis, the Kremlin appeared to be actively attempting to undermine the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel.\nIncited by Russian-language media reports, thousands of Russian-speaking protesters took to the streets carrying banners with slogans like \"Our Children Are In Danger.\"\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov gave the \"scandal\" an official stamp, accusing the German authorities of \"sweeping problems under the rug.\"\nThe story was soon proven false, but the damage was done -- and a message was sent that the Kremlin intended to play hardball.\nAnd play hardball it did, with a dizzying and almost nonstop barrage of hacking, doxing , fake news, support for fringe political forces, and other mischief.\nThe most high-profile example of this, of course, was the emerging consensus that Russia hacked the U.S. presidential election with the apparent goal of harming Hillary Clinton and/or helping Trump.\nBut while the hacking of the U.S. election garnered the most attention and headlines, it was far from the only case of Russia seeking to destabilize Western democracies.\n\"Putin is not done yet. He seeks to promote anti-establishment candidates in next year\u2019s elections in the Netherlands, France, Italy and Germany,\" Michael Khodarkovsky, a professor at Loyola University Chicago and author of the forthcoming book Russia\u2019s Twentieth Century, wrote in The New York Times .\nAnd Then We Take Berlin\nIn a letter to EU foreign-relations chief Federica Mogherini, 51 lawmakers from the European Parliament warned that more than $200 million of Russian black cash has been laundered through Europe and \"there is information that shows that the money has been used to influence European politics, media, and civil society.\"\nIn the United Kingdom, Russia's propaganda machine worked overtime to cheerlead for the Brexit campaign and its leader Nigel Farage.\nIn Italy, Kremlin-funded news outlets RT and Sputnik fed a barrage of fake news to a network of websites run by the far left Five Star Movement, spreading Euroskepticism, and anti-Americanism, and undermining a constitutional referendum that led to Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's resignation.\nThe Kremlin also continued to support Marine Le Pen, leader of the anti-immigrant National Front in France which was granted a 9 million euro loan from a Russian bank in 2015.\nAnd Le Pen's likely opponent in the second round of next year's presidential elections, former prime minister Francois Fillon, is also openly pro-Moscow.\nAnd in December, the ruling United Russia party signed a cooperation agreement with Austria's far-right Freedom Party.\n\"Despite being much weaker than the Soviet Union, Russia today nevertheless has a greater ability to provoke mischief than the communist empire ever did, while western debates on how to contain (or engage) Russia have an air of helplessness,\" political analyst Lilia Shevtsova wrote in The Financial Times .\nThe legacy of 2016 is a weakened, divided, and disillusioned West; and an emboldened Kremlin.\n\"If December 7, 1941, is a date which will live in infamy,\" Brian Frydenborg wrote on the blog War Is Boring , in reference to the attack on Pearl Harbor that brought the United States into World War II, \"then 2016 is a year which will live in infamy.\"\nThe views expressed in this blog post do not necessarily reflect the views of RFE/RL\nYour opinion",

Michael Rogers, head of the National Security Agency and the U.S. Cyber Command, spoke at a Wall Street Journal forum on Tuesday, and much of the focus of his discussion with WSJ Deputy Editor-in-Chief Rebecca Blumenstein was about joining government and business to fight the scourge of cyber crime. The number of hackers is \"so large and diverse\" that it's difficult to identify the perpetrators, he said, but roughly two-thirds of them are criminals looking to earn money from stealing personal information, and the remaining third are state-sponsored hackers.\nBut Blumenstein also asked Rogers about WikiLeaks, and the slow and steady leak of emails stolen from Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's gmail account. \"There shouldn't be any doubts in anybody's mind: This was not something that was done casually, this was not something that was done by chance, this was not a target that was selected purely arbitrarily,\" Rogers said. \"This was a conscious effort by a nation state to attempt to achieve a specific effect.\"\n\"A conscious effort by a nation-state to attempt to achieve a specific effect\" NSA chief on WikiLeaks https://t.co/kvmrTyVE30 #WSJCEOCouncil pic.twitter.com/AT2pxK2ROR \u2014 Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) November 15, 2016\nThe \"nation state\" in question is almost certainly Russia, which the U.S. intelligence community blames for the political hacking and distribution of internal Democratic emails throughout the campaign, evidently aimed at harming Clinton and by extension helping Donald Trump.

Russia and WikiLeaks were not responsible for Clinton using a private server as secretary of state, of course, nor did they force FBI Director James Comey to step into the campaign 11 days before Election Day, and again nine days after that. Clinton said the second intervention, where Comey said two days before the vote that there was nothing incriminating in the emails after all, damaged her campaign more than the earlier letter to Congress.

        "text": "Citigroup earnings: 'A tale of two Citis' Citigroup is the first big bank to report fourth-quarter earnings that disappointed investors. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) Citigroup failed to live up to Wall Street's expectations Thursday as it reported fourth quarter earnings that fell short of estimates. The bank reported a gain of 82 cents per share (backing out one-time gains and charges) on revenues of $17.8 billion. Analysts had expected Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) to post a profit of 95 cents per share on revenues of $18.2 billion, according to FactSet. Although net income was up sharply from a year ago to $2.7 billion, revenues for the fourth quarter were down 1% from the same period a year ago, Citigroup said. Citigroup said its retail banking revenue dropped as higher interest rates slowed its mortgage financing business. Investment banking revenues, derived from activities such as underwriting initial public offerings and advising companies on mergers, were up from a year earlier though. He said rising interest rates and elevated legal and regulatory costs weighed on results. But structural changes as well as an increase in loans and deposits should position the company for more robust growth in 2014, Corbat claimed. Still, he acknowledged some impatience on the part of investors. \"Being pleased with our progress doesn't make us satisfied and it doesn't make our shareholders,\" he said. Jeff Morris, head of U.S. equities for Standard Life Investments, which manages almost $300 billion, characterized Citi's earnings as mixed. He said that while bond-trading was \"clearly disappointing\" and that high expenses dampened profit, the bank showed strong international consumer loan growth. \"This quarter was really a tale of two Citis,\" he said. Daniel Marchon, an analyst with Raymond James Financial who covers the bank, thinks Citigroup may have dialed back some risk in the fourth quarter ahead of its stress test with the Federal Reserve scheduled for early this year. The stress tests are meant to help the Fed gauge how the banks would fare in another financial crisis. The financial sector is expected to have the best profit growth in the fourth quarter, according to FactSet Research. Overall, earnings for the companies in the S&P 500 are expected to be up 6.1% versus the fourth quarter of last year. Like other banks, Citigroup has clawed its way back since the depths of the financial crisis. But investors' expectations are now much higher for Citibank and all of its Wall Street rivals.",

The struggling department-store chain said 2,000 workers are being fired as a result of the closings, which are slated to be completed by early May. Penney, which operates about 1,100 stores and reported 110,000 employees in November, said the downsizing will cut annual costs by $65 million. The announcement, made after the market closed on Wednesday, got jeers rather than cheers on Wall Street, as Penney shares fell 1.4 percent in after-hours trading to $6.91. \"This does nothing to soothe the concerns about the holidays,\" said one investor, referring to Penney's vague press release last week saying it was \"pleased\" with year-end sales. \"If the holidays went well, you don't need to close any stores, and if they didn't go well, you need to close 300 stores, not 33,\" the investor added. What's more, hourly wages of affected workers, about 3,000, will be cut significantly, in many cases near minimum-wage levels, with no prospects of a raise in the future, according to some insiders. \"These people are going to end up making less than they were while being forced to work harder,\" according to one person close to the company. Separately, Penney confirmed it's bringing back sales commissions that had been banned by ex-CEO Ron Johnson, who believed pushy salespeople turned off shoppers. Employees selling window treatments and fine jewelry will be put on commission next month, while furniture salespeople will follow in March, JCPenney spokeswoman Kristin Hays said. There currently are no plans to revive commissions in other departments, she said.",

        "text": "Related. Younger people seem to have better memories because they are able to retrieve them in higher definition, scientists have found. Researchers found that it is not that younger people are able to remember more than older people but their memories seem better because they retrieve them in higher definition. Philip Ko of Vanderbilt University in the US, led the research team which focused on visual working memory, a person's ability to briefly retain a limited amount of visual information in the absence of visual stimuli. The team's examination of why this function is reduced during the course of healthy aging took the multiple stages of encoding, maintenance, and the retrieval of memorised information into account. They ran 11 older adults of around 67 years of age and 13 younger adults of approximately 23 years of age through a task called \u0091visual change detection'. This task consisted of viewing two, three or four coloured dots and memorising their appearance. These dots disappeared, and then after a few seconds the participants were presented with a single dot appearing in one of the memorised colours or a new colour. The accuracy of their response (\u0091same' or \u0091different') was considered to reflect how well they memorised the colours. This accuracy of response is referred to as \u0091behavioural measure'. Electroencephalographic data was also collected from the participants as they performed the task for a neural measure of their memory capacity. Ko found that while behavioural measures indicated a lower capacity in older adults than younger adults to memorise items, the neural measure of memory capacity was very similar in both groups. In other words, during the maintenance stage, both groups stored the same number of items. The researchers suggest that older adults store the items at a lower resolution than younger adults, resulting in impaired recollection. Unlike older adults, younger adults may be able to use perceptual implicit memory, a different kind of visual memory, to give them a \u0091boost' when they are trying to retrieve the stored information. \"We don't know why older adults perform poorly when their neural activity suggests their memory capacity is intact, but we have two leads,\" Ko said. \"First, further analysis of this current dataset and other studies from our laboratory suggest that older adults retrieve memories differently than younger adults. \"Second, there is emerging. evidence from other labs suggesting that the quality of older adults' memories is poorer than younger adults. \"In other words, while older adults might store the same number of items, their memory of each item is \u0091fuzzier' than that of younger adults,\" Ko said. The study appears in the journal Attention, Perception & Psychophysics, published by Springer.",

        "text": "Japan's ties with India do not target any country. They are solely intended to strengthen peace and stability in Asia. Three individuals will set the agenda for the general elections. In Indian mythology, the Trimurti referred to the three gods of Hinduism; Brahma the Creator, Vishnu the Sustainer, and Shiva the Destroyer. Here's a thought. The triad and their titles, in many ways, have a connect to the three leaders who will set the agenda for the Lok Sabha elections next summer. Narendra Modi, recently charged by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with being a destroyer, Arvind Kejriwal, who has created a potentially gamechanging political force out of nothing, and Rahul Gandhi, who, of late, has started to establish a more substantial, sustainable image by taking a clearer stand on issues that matter to the voting public, and not just sections of it. The fact that the triumvirate who will dominate the coming polls are so different from the choices we have had in all previous elections, makes it not just a tantalising prospec but also a huge leap in terms of its potential for positive change. Kejriwal stormed Delhi's citadels with just one key weapon: corruption. Gandhi may not yet be the official candidate but he will set the agenda for the Congress. Till recently, that agenda was largely indeterminate and ad hoc, leaving the public wondering whether he lacked a coherent vision. In the last month, he has grasped the political nettle and made it clear that his main focus will be anti-corruption, taking a leaf from Kejriwal's book. Modi has also railed against corruption, albeit in an anti-Congress context, in all his election-related speeches so far. All three key players on an anti-corruption platform cannot be a bad thing for our democracy. There is also the age factor and thought process. Kejriwal is 45, Gandhi is 43, so both belong to a different generation than the current leadership in the two main parties. Modi may be 63, but he thinks out of the box and makes use of a young man's tools, social media. Plus, he has repeatedly stressed the importance of India's youth and the democratic dividend they offer. Kejriwal is an IIT graduate and his engineering background has given him a logical, clearsighted thought process. He may be the most unconventional leader we have, but his aim is to change politics from within, and that alone, has set him up in the eyes of many as the future hope for the country. He remains, of course, the most unpredictable of the three. It is still not clear how his party will make the leap to the national stage and retain its core electoral attraction, cleanliness in politics, a rejection of traditional political culture and decentralisation of decision-making and authority. He is surrounded by a group of first-timers in politics who, at times, struggle to deal with the reality of their newly acquired status. That may not last and once the nerves and jitters subside, we should have a clearer idea of where the party is headed in terms of forging a national identity. It's clearly too early to say what national appeal it will have come election 2014, but the party has already grabbed the media spotlight from others, and it is now for the rest to play catch-up. In a sense, their phenomenal debut suggests they have already set the agenda for 2014. The trio's change-making potential lies the most in the economic and corporate sphere. Modi is already established as pro-business, pro-development and is widely expected to further liberalise the economy. His image in Gujarat has been of an efficient leader who is able to motivate the bureaucracy and bend them to his will. More recently, he has spoken about the urgent need for tax reforms. There is no question that he will create a more favourable business climate should he come to power. Gandhi's earlier ambiguity on economic issues has given way to a clearer enunciation of where he stands, most notably at the recent speech to business leaders at FICCI, where he talked of time-bound decisions on infrastructure projects, balancing environmental clearances with industry needs, fast-tracking clearances through the Cabinet Committee on Investment, building a robust and open real estate market and a framework of legislation to fight corruption. Kejriwal is the dark horse. Most see him as a quasi-Marxist. He has adopted a spin-off of the Gandhian concept of swaraj, which lays stress on self-governance, community-building and decentralisation of power. However, he has also said that: \"If we find our solution in the Left we are happy to borrow it from there. If we find our solution in the Right, we are happy to borrow it from there.\" Kejriwal may not be a candidate in the Lok Sabha elections but his influence is spreading across the country and it will inspire other leaders to read from his script, mainly to minimise corruption and influence peddling, introduce transparency in government and create a level playing field. The battle is not yet joined, Modi and Gandhi come with heavy baggage, and much could change between now and the elections. But based on early evidence, the political Trimurti lording over Election 2014 will be in a position to make a positive impact on an increasingly discredited Indian polity and an economy under emergency care.",

        "text": "David Booth beats the market without picking stocks. \"If you want to hold a market portfolio, that's fine...we think you can do better,\" says David Booth, chairman and co-CEO of Dimensional Fund Advisors. NEW YORK (Money Magazine) David Booth built Dimensional Fund Advisors on the idea that investors can't beat the market. The mutual fund company's assets now run to more than $300 billion. So what's the secret of Booth's smashing success? Beating the market. Long before it was fashionable, Booth, 67, bet his career on \"passive\" investing -- that is, buying and holding a representative slice of equities instead of trying to choose the next winners. As a grad student he was a research assistant to the economist who would later win a Nobel for showing that even smart investors can't predict stock prices. In the 1970s, Booth worked on one of the first institutional index funds, which simply held every listed stock on the New York exchange. He co-founded Dimensional in 1981 with a pioneering mutual fund that passively owned stocks of small companies. Dimensional does, however, preach that investors can capture a better long-run return by \"tilting\" their portfolios to favor certain parts of the market (for example, smaller companies). Performance also differs: The company's DFA U.S. Core Equity 1 ( DFEOX ) fund earned an annualized 19.6% over the past five years, compared with 18.4% for an index of the total stock market. It's tough to buy Dimensional funds: They're sold only through financial advisers who tend to work with the wealthy, and in 401(k)s and some 529 college savings plans. But you're sure to be hearing more ideas like Booth's. And bolder claims too. The heyday of what you might call the artisanal fund manager -- a stock picker who carefully selects, say, 50 or 100 companies -- is waning. The success of index funds, now 28% of fund assets and growing, is a big part of that. Some passive managers, however, are using historical patterns and statistical models to create funds that make broad strategic bets. Besides Dimensional, players now include BlackRock , the world's largest asset manager. Taking a more radical position is MIT economist Andrew Lo . He's aiming not only to improve on the academic theory that drives both traditional indexers and Dimensional but also to create a new breed of funds he hopes will be as transformative as the original index funds. What to expect in the stock market in 2014. Proponents of these different approaches can marshal intriguing evidence. There's also reason to be skeptical. Popular tilted strategies have done well in recent years, which can make it harder to see the risks they carry. And marketing, as much as research, is driving the industry's enthusiasm. \"Investors have woken up to the fact that it's hard to beat the market, and investment managers need a new story to tell,\" says Paul Baiocchi, an ETF analyst at the research firm IndexUniverse. \"This is the new story.\" It's also the investing debate that matters now -- not the choice between passive and active stock picking, but between passive or passive with a twist. According to IndexUniverse, among exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest in stocks, one in three employ one of these new strategies. Here's a close look at the arguments behind the \"do better\" portfolios and lessons you can apply to your own investing, even if you decide to stick with simpler funds. The Trailblazer: Tweaking the winning formula. Dimensional, which began as a two-man operation based in a Brooklyn apartment, has grown to 800 employees, with its headquarters in an airy, modern-art-filled campus on a hilltop in Austin. Booth's success allowed him to give $300 million to the graduate business program at the University of Chicago. It's now called Booth School of Business. That gift was not for nothing. The University of Chicago gave Booth not just his MBA but a front-row seat for an investing revolution. Booth and Dimensional co-founder Rex Sinquefield were students of Eugene Fama, who had developed a powerful idea called the \"efficient-markets hypothesis.\" The basic premise: When new information that could drive a company's stock price up or down comes out -- a new product, say, or an accounting scandal -- information hits the street so quickly that it is instantly factored into prices. There is no reliable way for investors to beat the market. That's one reason, along with low costs, that index funds consistently beat the average fund manager. As of mid-2013, for example, 72% of U.S. stock funds lagged the S&P Composite 1500, an index of the broad market, over the past five years. Fama, who is on Dimensional's board, won the Nobel Memorial Prize in 2013 for the efficient-markets hypothesis. But in the early 1990s he made other findings that were just as important to investors like Booth. Along with economist Ken French, Fama showed that small companies and value stocks -- those trading cheaply compared with the assets on their books -- tend to earn higher returns than the market. Dimensional's funds are vehicles for capturing such effects. The original fund, DFA U.S. MicroCap ( DFSCX ) , is an index-like portfolio of small companies. The newer U.S Core Equity 1, launched in 2005, owns a wider swath of the market but is weighted to smaller and cheaper. It charges annual fees of 0.19%, compared with as little as 0.04% for a plain index, but far less than the average 1.4% for stock funds. Tilting presents a ticklish problem. If there's evidence that certain stocks outperform, how can markets also be efficient? Why don't investors pile into those great stocks, bidding up prices and thereby eliminating the higher returns? \"They are riskier,\" explains Booth. Small companies often have untested business models. The value effect is less intuitive; it seems like a cheaper stock should be safer. Yet the discount could mean the market sees something wobbly in the business. James Montier, of the active fund managers GMO, says you may be disappointed if you get in on tilting now. \"They are not priced to work,\" he says. \"They are quite expensive.\" Booth, of course, doesn't make such calls but cautions that a tweaked approach can leave you out of step with the market at times. U.S. MicroCap has annualized returns of 12.5% since its 1981 inception, compared with 11.6% for the S&P 500. But the fund lagged for almost a decade before the winds shifted. \"People were disillusioned, but they realized that for a long-term strategy, you've got to accept that risk and return are related,\" says Booth. \"We were able to defend it.\" It's not that Dimensional never changes its thinking. Booth is excited about new research showing that companies with higher profits, relative to the assets on their books, seem to earn better returns. Dimensional is adding that factor to its tilts. \"The really good ideas come along about every decade or so,\" he says. The takeaway for yo u . If you can't get into a Dimensional fund, there are other ways to tilt. On the MONEY 50 recommended list, the Vanguard Small Cap Value ETF ( VBR ) captures both the value and size effects; it's earned an annualized 21.1% over five years, vs. 16.9% for the S&P 500. There's a lesson, too, even for those who prefer to stick with a broad-market index. Popular S&P 500 index funds tilt away from the small-cap effect because they hold more of the biggest stocks. A better core choice is Vanguard Total Stock Market ( VTI ) , which includes small companies.

        "text": "Most government scandals involve the manipulation of the system in obscure ways by people no one has ever heard of. That is why George Washington Bridgegate is nearly a perfect scandal \u0097 because it is comprehensible and (as they say in Hollywood) \"relatable\" to everyone who has ever been in a car. This is the reason this one is not going to go away so easily, even if one accepts the contention that Gov. Chris Christie had nothing whatsoever to do with it. Government officials and political operatives working for Christie, for weird and petty reasons, chose to make traffic worse. That's the takeaway. When they are reminded of the fact that people working on Christie's behalf thought it was a good political game to mire tens of thousands of their fellow Americans in the nightmarish gridlock that is a daily dreaded prospect for tens of millions, they will be discomfited by that and by the politician in whose name it was done. And yet, you know what is also something everybody would find \"relatable\"? Politicians who sic the tax man on others for political gain. Everybody has to deal with the IRS and fears it. Last year, we learned from the Internal Revenue Service itself that it had targeted ideological opponents of the president for special scrutiny and investigation \u0097 because they were ideological opponents. That's juicy, just as Bridgegate is juicy. It's something we can all understand, it speaks to our greatest fears, and it's the sort of thing TV newspeople could gab about for days on end without needing a fresh piece of news to keep it going. And yet, according to Scott Whitlock\u00a0of the Media Research Center, \"In less than 24 hours, the three networks have devoted 17 times more coverage to a traffic scandal involving Chris Christie than they've allowed in the last six months to Barack Obama's Internal Revenue Service controversy.\" Why? Oh, come on, you know why. Christie belongs to one political party. Obama belongs to the other. You know which ones they belong to. And you know which ones the people at the three networks belong to, too: In surveys going back decades, anywhere from 80% to 90% of Washington's journalists say they vote Democratic. Scandals are not just about themselves; they are about the media atmosphere that surrounds them. They are perpetuated and deepened by the attention of journalists, whose relentless pursuit of every angle keeps the story going. That is exactly what has been missing from the IRS scandal from its outset; Republicans in Congress have been the dogged pursuers, not the press. There was plenty of material. Just as journalists remain skeptical today about who exactly might have gotten the idea for the lane closures, they could have been asking without letup who got the idea to dig into conservative tax-status applications. Several officials at the IRS resigned, retired and took the Fifth, just as was the case with Christie-aligned Port Authority officials. It's pretty clear the questions about how high up Bridgegate went are going to be pursued far more diligently than they have been in the IRS case. What gives? There is a fundamental misunderstanding among conservatives about the causes of partisan media bias \u0097 the reason there is unequal coverage of scandals of this kind. It exists not because there is a conscious effort to soft-pedal bad news for politicians you like and to push hard on bad news for politicians you don't. It's actually more personal \u0097 more relatable, shall we say\u0097than that. Journalists know the Obamans. Intimately. They know them from college, they know them from work, they know them from kids' soccer. They're literally married to them. To the journalists, the Obamans don't look like crooks and cheats. Far from it. For them, it's like looking in a mirror. In September, Elspeth Reeve of The Atlantic Wire took note of 24 major journalists who have taken posts at senior levels in the Obama administration. All of them have worked for decades in various news organizations, thus creating personal ties and bonds of affection with literally hundreds of working reporters and editors. The journalists are not covering up for their friends and their spouses. They just believe the people they know could not be responsible for behaving badly, or cravenly, or for crass political advantage \u0097and the tone they strike when such things are discussed is often one of offense, as though it is a sign of low character to believe otherwise. It would be, well, like believing the journalists themselves were crooks. It's fair to say that most conservatives don't know people in the Obama administration, and they dislike and disagree with its policies. When they look at it, their dislike and lack of any personal connection make it easier for them to see officials mired in scandal and tush-covering cover-up. This is a direct analogue to the way liberals \u0097 of whom journalists comprise a central cohort \u0097 viewed the George W. Bush and Reagan administrations. They saw people with whom they disagreed and who they thought were bad for the country and so found it much easier to believe they were acting out of malign motive and doing evil. Christie may be entirely innocent of all wrongdoing. Or there may be some connection, even a very tenuous and suggestive one. But there will be little let-up now. For in the end, because Christie is a Republican. Christie isn't them.",

        "text": "Seleka soldiers drive on a street during fighting in Bangui. Photo: Reuters. BANGUI, Central African Republic \u0097 Fighting swept through the capital of Central African Republic on Thursday, leaving nearly one hundred people dead and posing the biggest threat yet to the country's new government. The U.N. Security Council authorized an intervention force to prevent a bloodbath between Christians and Muslims. Witnesses and aid workers say at least 98 people are dead in Bangui after a day of clashes between the Muslim armed fighters who rule the country and a Christian militia who opposes them. An Associated Press journalist counted 48 bodies at a mosque in a northern neighborhood late Thursday. Separately, Doctors Without Borders confirmed at least 50 people were dead at hospitals they are running. The armed Christian fighters attacked the capital before dawn, in the most serious violence to hit Bangui since a March coup brought the Seleka rebel coalition to power. The former rebels are accused of committing scores of human rights abuses. The Christian militias who support the deposed president are implicated in massacres on Muslim communities. In Bangui, people scurried indoors, some seeking sanctuary in a church. Inside a Bangui hospital, dozens of people with gunshot wounds lay on the floor or on wooden benches, waiting for hours to see a physician. Underscoring the chaos, even the president's and prime minister's homes were looted. The U.N. Security Council unanimously authorized increased military action by France and African troops aimed at restoring security and protecting civilians in the volatile former French colony. Speaking from the Elysee Palace in Paris, French President Francois Hollande promised that the 600 hundred troops in the country will be doubled \"within a few days, even a few hours.\" He said the Central African Republic was \"calling us for help,\" and he \"decided to act immediately.\" The country's prime minister welcomed the intervention while in Paris for a summit of dozens of African leaders hosted by Hollande. In his first reaction to the move, Prime Minister Nicolas Tiangaye told The Associated Press that he sees it \"very positively\" and that he had wanted a \"firm reaction from France.\" He called for fast action \"to put an end to this violence and these atrocities.\" Tiangaye confirmed his house had been looted, describing the attackers as a group of Seleka who arrived in three pickup trucks. \"It's true, my house was attacked and pillaged,\" he said, adding that his family was evacuated beforehand and were safe. Hours after fighting broke out, Central African Republic's president, who was installed by Seleka earlier this year, said the clashes were over. By afternoon, the streets were empty of all but military vehicles and the four-wheel-drive trucks favored by Seleka. Babacar Gaye, the U.N. special representative for the Central African Republic, appealed for calm in a joint statement from the U.N., European Union, African Union and France. Seleka is an unlikely group of allies who united a year ago with the goal of forcing President Francois Bozize from the presidency after a decade in power. After thousands of rebels besieged Bangui in March, Bozize fled and the insurgents installed their leader Michel Djotodia as president. Djotodia has increasingly sought to distance himself from Seleka, which has been blamed for scores of atrocities in Bangui, killing and raping civilians and stealing from aid groups and orphanages. He has even less control in the distant provinces where anger over Seleka human rights abuses fueled the formation of the Christian anti-balaka movement several months ago. Balaka means \"machete.\" While the anti-balaka fighters include villagers defending their communities against Seleka attacks, the group is believed to be receiving support from Bozize allies. The anti-balaka fighters also have been implicated in massacres on Muslim civilian populations, which also have suffered under the Seleka regime and say they are being unfairly blamed for the destruction. The U.N. Security Council resolution authorizes the deployment of an African Union-led force to Central African Republic for a year to protect civilians and restore security and public order. The AU force is replacing a regional peacekeeping mission whose presence has been mainly limited to the capital and a few northern cities. The U.N. resolution also authorizes French forces, for a temporary period, \"to take all necessary measures\" to support the AU-led force known as MISCA, whose troop numbers are expected to rise from about 2,500 to 3,500.",

        "text": "What if there's another dog in the fight for Masahiro Tanaka, and it belongs to Derek Holland? Stick with us here: Holland, the Texas Rangers left-hander, suffered a left knee injury this week that will require surgery and keep him out until midseason. Holland, who pitched to a 3.42 ERA last season in a team-leading 213 innings, said he went down while playing with his pet boxer Wrigley \u0097 he's just asking for bad luck with that name \u0097 in one of those freak sports pratfalls. \"I was running around with the dog and took off up the stairs,\" Holland told the Dallas Morning News. \"He chased me and ran up under me and undercut me, and I slammed my head on the steps. \"It could have been worse. I could have cracked my head open. I was doing a typical guy thing, clowning around with the dog thing, and this happened.\" Derek Holland Photo: Getty Images. The Rangers suddenly face a serious void in their starting rotation, just as bidding for free-agent Japanese right-hander Masahiro Tanaka \u0097 who is coveted by the Yankees \u0097 enters its final two weeks. Tanaka was reported to have returned to Japan this weekend after meeting in Los Angeles with representatives from an array of big league clubs. The Yankees, as well as the L.A.-based Dodgers and Angels, are regarded as the favorites to land the 25-year-old import, who likely will command a pact in the $100 million range in addition to payment of a $20 million posting fee to his Japanese team. But the Rangers, who made Shin-Soo Choo their big-ticket offseason acquisition and have\u00a0Japanese stud Yu Darvish at the top of their rotation, have an affinity for Tanaka , deep pockets and now a pressing need for a front-end starter. Those are potential ingredients for a late-breaking candidate to snare Tanaka away from the Yankees.",

        "text": "It will take a lot of persuading and a lot of money to get Floyd Mayweather to fight anywhere but the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. But insiders insist there remains a possibility the pound-for-pound king of boxing could be holding his next bout at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Mayweather is tentatively scheduled to fight sometime this spring in what would be the third bout of his six-fight deal with Showtime. The problem is selecting an opponent that will generate the kind of pay-per-view revenue that will earn everyone a profit. He dispensed of his most attractive opponent last September when Mayweather scored an easy decision over Mexico's Saul \"Canelo\" Alvarez. The pay-per-view bout did record-setting numbers generating $150 million on 2.2 million pay-per-view buys. But it may have left the cubboard bare as to quality opposition in future bouts. Amir Kham and Marcos Maidana have been speculated as possible opponents for Mayweather. But nothing is signed. Investors need upwards of 1 million pay-per view buys to break even and having the fight at the Barclays Center could create added interest. \"It would be like LeBron coming to town,\" a source close to the situation said. \"It would light up the Barclays Center.\" A Mayweather bout at the Barclays wouldn't generate the type of gate that could be made in Las Vegas and there are tax issues that might deter Mayweather from fighting in New York. But the media exposure he would receive could equate into enough added pay-per-view revenue to ensure his guarantee. Mayweather is clearly partial to fighting in Las Vegas, his hometown. But he seemed open to taking the Mayweather Experience elsewhere as long as his minimum guarantee is met. \"My guarantee will never be under $32 million, never,\" he told Fighthype.com. A Mayweather fight in the spring is one of several bouts to look forward to in 2014. The boxing schedule begins next weekend when Canada's former world champions Jean Pascal and Lucian Bute battle from the Bell Centre in Montreal; and on Jan. 25 Mikey Garcia faces Juan Carlos Burgos in a junior lightweight title fight at the Garden Theater. HBO will televise both bouts. Meanwhile, Alvarez is expected to return on March 8 against Alfredo Angulo of Mexico at the MGM, while Manny Pacquiao is set to fight April 12 in Las Vegas against a yet to be named opponents. More locally, the final boxing card ever at the famed Roseland Ballroom is set for Feb. 12 when Broadway Boxing features \"The Last Dance.\" Bouts on the card will see New York fan-favorites Heather \"The Heat\" Hardy, an undefeated super bantamweight and West Point graduate junior middleweight Boyd \"The Rainmaker\" Melson in separate eight-round bouts. Here are a few main courses I also would like to see in 2014: Adonis Stevenson vs. Sergey Kovalev for the unified light heavyweight title fight; Gennady Golovkin vs. Andre Ward at super middleweight; Peter Quillin vs. Danny Jacobs for the middleweight title; and Miguel Cotto vs. Sergio Martinez at a catch weight. Mayweather is signed with Showtime, while Pacquiao is loyal to HBO though he doesn't have a multi-fight deal in place. Further complicating matters, Pacquiao's promoter Top Rank and Mayweather are sworn enemies though the Pac camp says Top Rank boss Bob Arum, \"would not get in the way\" of a Mayweather fight. Pacquiao has agreed to drug-testing and taking less money, but the probability of Mayweather-Pacquiao in the fall could hinge on how well Mayweather's fight in the spring does. A poor PPV showing in his bout against Robert Guerrero last May earned just 850,000 buys and cost Showtime $8-$10 million. That prompted the rush to match him in the ultimate money-maker against Alvarez last September. Another disappointing PPV result in his upcoming fight this spring could add more urgency to a match with Pacquiao.",

        "text": "MUMBAI: Among the Infosys executives who were ever even remotely in contention for the CEO post \u0097 Mohandas Pai , V Balakrishnan, Ashok Vemuri and now BG Srinivas and UB Pravin Rao \u0097 the last is perhaps the least known. Last week, when Infosys disbanded its executive council and appointed two presidents, BG Srinivas and UB Pravin Rao, many concluded that the race to succeed D Shibulal had narrowed down to just two. Though Rao has seen very little public limelight, he is well-regarded and respected within the company, present and former Infosys executives say. Industry sources say Rao, 51, was on the ball about the changes that the company needed urgently much before Murthy came back. In that sense, his rise within Infosys actually began even before NR Narayana Murthy returned as chairman in June 2013. \"Pravin was always more vocal about the changes that were coming,\" one very close observer of the company told ET on condition of anonymity. Rao had foreseen that the focus of the company would shift back to bread-and- butter large outsourcing contracts as many as 5-6 quarters before Murthy came back, the person said. The focus would shift away from consulting to business operations and margins would fall, Rao had anticipated. \"Everything he'd foreseen has come true,\" the person said. Yet, in all this, Rao mostly remained out of public glare. People who have worked with him describe him as self-effacing, but very capable. \"The retail (industry) vertical under Pravin (Rao) has shown steady growth despite being a sector that's very competitive,\" points out Subash Dhar, former head of innovation and sales of Infosys. Indeed retail, Infosys executives point out, was one of the first verticals within the company that started building solutions. In fact, many of the solutions, which are currently part of Infosys' Platforms, Products and Solutions play, are from the retail vertical that Rao led. \"Retail was way ahead in investing in solutions,\" adds Dhar. Outside of the co-founders, Rao is the closest who comes to being one. He joined Infosys just five years after it was founded and was still operating out of a twostorey building in the city. Back then, it was yet to achieve any of its early success. The electrical engineering graduate from Bangalore University was hired after being interviewed by NR Narayana Murthy and NS Raghavan . \"I joined Infosys at a princely salary ofRs 1,300 much to the dismay of my wellwishers, ignoring three other wonderful job offers,\" Rao recollected a few years ago, when Infosys completed 30 years. The other quality that comes up time and again in conversations about Rao is his people skills. S Swaminathan, former CEO of Infosys BPO, says he encourages dissent and discussion. \"He delegates well and carries his people along. These are qualities that stand out,\" says Swaminathan. Rao enables ideas to germinate under his leadership, adds Dhar. Over time, Rao has taken on several leadership roles such as head of infrastructure management services and delivery head for Europe. He was heading the retail, consumer goods, logistics and life sciences verticals before his promotion last week. A few months ago, he was given additional responsibility for Infosys Leadership Institute, a position that was lying vacant since Mathew Barney, its previous head, quit in March last. BG Srinivas or Ashok Vemuri (who quit Infosys to join iGate in September), were more client facing and were also located in Infosys' biggest markets . But Rao, who has mostly been based in India, to that extent, Rao has been less client facing, a criteria increasingly being considered as important to lead the business. But those who have worked with him refute the contention. \"At that level, there is nothing like a client-facing role or not. Retail has marquee clients like P&G \u0097 it has been one of the fastest growing verticals for Infosys,\" points out one person. Other associates say Rao has been in difficult client situations and has stayed calm, dealing with the situation in a balanced manner. The other perception about Rao is that he is not ambitious. \"He's diligent and hardworking and a great thinker, but probably not as ambitious,\" says an analyst with an overseas brokerage. Rao was not part of the executive council when it was first formed. Rao has now been appointed to the Infosys board after former CFO V Balakrishnan resigned in December. The best praise for Rao also comes from people who were part of his team, \"Pravin (Rao) is a Guru in the setup. He is a person who can give you a strong direction. Nobody understands Infosys like he does.\"",

        "text": "Related. Thailand's government stuck to a plan for a February election on Wednesday despite mounting pressure from protesters who have brought parts of Bangkok to a near standstill, and said it believed support for the leader of the agitation was waning. Some hardline protesters have threatened to blockade the stock exchange and an air traffic control facility if Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra does not step down by a deadline media said had been set for 8 p.m. (1300 GMT). The unrest, which flared in early November and escalated this week when demonstrators occupied main intersections of the capital, is the latest chapter in an eight year conflict. The country's political fault line pits the Bangkok-based middle class and royalist establishment against the mostly poorer, rural supporters of Yingluck and her brother, Thaksin Shinawatra, a former premier ousted by the military in 2006 who is seen as the power behind her government. Yingluck invited protest leaders and political parties to discuss a proposal to delay the general election, which she has called for Feb. 2, but her opponents snubbed her invitation. After the meeting, the government said the poll would go ahead as scheduled, and it derided the leader of the protest movement, Suthep Thaugsuban. \"We believe the election will bring the situation back to normal,\" Deputy Prime Minister Pongthep Thepkanchana told reporters. \"We can see that the support of Mr Suthep is declining. When he is doing something against the law, most people do not support that.\" AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL ASSURED. Protest leaders say demonstrators will occupy the city's main arteries until an unelected \"people's council\" replaces\u00a0 Yingluck's administration, which they accuse of corruption and nepotism. Thaksin's rural and working-class support has ensured he or his allies have won every election since 2001 and Yingluck's Puea Thai Party seems certain to win any vote held under present arrangements. The protesters want to suspend what they say is a democracy commandeered by the self-exiled billionaire Thaksin, whom they accuse of nepotism and corruption, and eradicate the political influence of his family by altering electoral arrangements. There were no signs of trouble at the two targets named by hardliners in the protest movement \u0096 the stock exchange and the central Bangkok offices of AeroThai, which is in charge of air traffic control communication for planes using Thai air space. AeroThai said it had back-up operations to ensure no disruption to air travel if its control centre was shut down. \"For en-route services AeroThai has set up a back-up centre working parallel to our primary system,\" company president Prajak Sajjasophon told Reuters. \"We can assure you services will not be affected if protesters force our headquarters to shut down operations.\" Suthep's supporters have blockaded at least seven big Bangkok intersections and are also trying to stop ministries from functioning, forcing many to remain closed, with civil servants working from back-up facilities or from home. Yingluck herself has been unable to work from her offices in Government House since late November. The protests could cost the economy as much as 1 billion baht ($30\u00a0 million) a day, according to a survey by the University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce. Demonstrators marched to the home of Energy Minister Pongsak Raktapongpaisal on Wednesday, carrying a coffin with his name on it, ASTV news reported. They handed one of his aides a note demanding that he cut LPG prices and resign, it said. According to the official Twitter account of National Police spokesman Piya Utayo, an off-duty policeman dressed in civilian clothes was attacked and had his gun taken off him by about 10 protesters at a rally near the Energy Ministry. \"RED SHIRTS\" TO STAY OUT OF BANGKOK. The latest protests have been less violent than a spasm of unrest in 2010, when troops were sent in to end a two-month protest in central Bangkok by \"red shirt\" Thaksin supporters. More than 90 people died during those protests. Thaksin, who turned to politics after making a fortune in telecommunications, redrew Thailand's political map by courting rural voters. He now lives in exile to avoid a jail sentence handed down in 2008 for abuse of power. In this upsurge of unrest there have been relatively few factional clashes. Government supporters said they held protests on Monday and Tuesday in provinces neighbouring Bangkok but had no plans to demonstrate in the city. \"All we ask is that Prime Minister Yingluck does not resign,\" said Worawut Wichaidit, spokesman for the pro-government United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship. \"If (Suthep) and his group achieve their goal \u0085 the outcome would be similar to a coup, and we all saw what happened the last time there was a coup,\" Worawut said, referring to instability and factional strife in the years that followed the last army takeover. It is widely thought that, if the agitation grinds on, the judiciary or the military may step in. The military has staged or attempted 18 coups in 81 years of on-off democracy, although it has tried to stay neutral this time and army chief Prayuth Chan-ocha has publicly refused to take sides.",

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: After the vitriolic attack on it by Congress, Delhi's ruling AAP faced more criticism today with BJP asserting the country is being presented with \"gimmickry\" and the road to \"anarchy\" and NCP saying the party was yet to spell out its ideology. BJP also used the accusations levelled by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Vinod Kumar Binny to attack Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government, charging it with \"compromising\" with corruption and \"duping\" the people of Delhi. Targeting senior AAP leaders, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley said there is an in-built danger in establishing a political party and then going out to search its members and its ideology and noted that a group of \"disparate, self-opinionated persons\" has flocked to the new outfit. \"India was promised alternative politics. I had personally hoped that alternative politics promised by AAP would lead to larger footprints on the Indian society. Conventional political parties and politicians would realize the importance of probity and accountability. Instead, the country is being presented with gimmickry and the road to anarchy,\" Jaitley said in an article. He also said the alternative politics promised by the new outfit has faltered. He cautioned the political parties that this failure should not be confused by the message of setting higher standards of probity and accountability. \"My fear is that the failure of this experiment should not be confused by other parties as a failure of the good message of higher standards of probity and accountability.\" NCP asked AAP to explain its stand on secularism and reservation for backward classes and minorities. The one-year-old party is yet to give a clear view on where it stands on the principles of secularism and it should spell out its ideology, NCP spokesman Nawab Malik told a press conference in Mumbai. When the late HRD minister Arjun Singh introduced reservations for OBCs in IIMs and IITs, Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia's youth for equality forum opposed the move, he said. \"The party should clarify if it is opposed to reservations,\" Malik said. In the fiercest attack yet by outside supporter Congress on AAP, senior party leader and Union Minister Salman Khurshid yesterday dubbed it as \"anarchist\" with \"jurassic\" ideas out to destroy the system and also with some of the \"worst, stinking, third grade\" people across the country.",

        "text": "The fifth cut-off list for undergraduate admissions in Delhi University saw as many as 13 of 60 colleges closing admissions for all courses on Monday,while others have kept admissions open for up to four courses. FIITJEE Limited,a private coaching institute,has been directed by the Consumer Forum to refund the fee of a student for enrolling him in a school that was not affiliated with the Central Board Secondary Education. Withdrawals after the third cut-off list and fear of more to come led to many top Delhi University colleges,including Shri Ram College of Commerce,keeping admissions open in the fourth list of cut-offs for under-graduate courses,released late on Thursday. Most colleges have closed admissions for general category students with the second list,leaving students hoping that they could get a seat in their preferred college or course through the extra curricular activities quota. The Allahabad High Court on Tuesday ordered registration of FIR and investigation by the CB-CID in connection with disbursement of scholarships worth over Rs 2 lakh by the principal of an inter college. Ludhiana's textile industry,which has been lamenting a shortage of fashion designers,has a reason to cheer as a city college,under Panjab University,formally launched a postgraduate degree in fashion designing on Tuesday. An FIR was lodged against several students of Lucknow University for creating ruckus and hurting three security guards at the varsity's new campus during the ongoing admission counselling for the next academic session. Many Delhi University colleges closed admissions to a majority of under-graduate courses even as a few including some top colleges remained open for admission in the third cut-off list released by the university on Monday. Owing to the easy availability of application forms for admission to Panjab University Departments on the university's website,from this year,the helpdesks set up by the student organisations failed to attract much footfall as compared to last year's records. The University Women Development Cell (UWDC) of Mumbai University (MU) has ordered the management of Terna Engineering College,Nerul,to transfer its coordinator for allegedly molesting a woman professor. As many as 20 new medical colleges,including nine in the public sector,will be opened this year,the chairman of the Board of Governors of the Medical Council of India,Dr K K Talwar,announced on Sunday. The Gujarat Technological University(GTU) has warned 12 management colleges including one in Ahmedabad city that monetary penalty would be imposed on them if they failed to comply with the university's directions regarding academic and other infrastructure facilities in their colleges by July 31.",

        "text": "Related. Owls have never been very popular: We say they're birds of ill omen, but really, that's because we're scared of them. They emerge at dusk and hunt by night, they have huge all-seeing front-facing eyes and an uncanny, disconcerting ability to swivel their heads around 180 degrees. They fly soundlessly, and will dig their claws into your back if you are a rat. When they call out to each other, some sound like the foghorn hooters of ghostly ships, others screech and shriek like a convention of hysterical witches scratching each others' eyes out at a supermarket rat sale. In many parts of the world (ours included) they're hunted for their body parts which are used for black magic rituals or in traditional \"medicine\". And these days, the spotted owlets in the Nicholson cemetery in Civil Lines, Delhi, which my bedroom overlooks, are chittering and squabbling querulously even at three in the morning. It is their breeding season and the stress of love and courtship and fighting rivals makes them (as it does us) tetchy. Actually, they're sweet dumpy looking birds, with icing sugar spots on their round brown heads, big golden eyes and an endearing way of bobbing their heads as they try and get a measure of you. Sometimes you can see them during the day. One monsoon morning, many years ago, a spotted owlet (pictured right) camped in a small tree right in front of my balcony for the entire day, unperturbed by the agitation it caused amongst other birds. It wasn't injured; it just stayed, meditating calmly on the tree till dusk and allowed me to go virtually right up to it, without flicking a feather. At dusk, it flew off. The other fairly common \"resident\" owl in Delhi is the mushroom coloured barn owl, with its heart-shaped face and a terrifying repertoire of shrieks and screeches. One never-to-be-forgotten winter morning in Qudsia gardens, near Kashmere Gate, I watched a pair smooch passionately as a frosty sun came up: with a face shaped thus what else could you expect? Three woolly babies, perched one on top of the other, grumpily waited for their parents to finish canoodling as the babblers and mynas began heckling. Owls are known to fly silently. Just how silently, I realised, at a Raptor Rehabilitation Centre in California years ago. Three or four barn owls were recuperating in a huge cage and would regularly fly up and down the length of this. Watching from three feet away, I couldn't hear the faintest whisper of a wing-beat. It was uncanny; like watching a silent film. With their acute hearing and eyesight, and this phantom flight, their prey \u0097 rats and other rodents mainly \u0097 have a hope in hell to escape. With their fierce, glowering expression, you would imagine owls would be very straitlaced and proper, puritanical even in their family life. No hanky-panky or mucking around with multifarious boyfriends and girlfriends here. But.",

        "text": "NEW DELHI: Reliance Industries' surprise entry into auction for mobile phone spectrum has raised the prospect of fierce bidding, intensifying competition in a crowded cellular market that has seen margins improve after a lengthy price war. Reliance, controlled by Mukesh Ambani , sits on a cash pile of nearly $15 billion, which gives it an advantage at the spectrum auction over rivals like market leader Bharti Airtel Ltd, which had nearly $10 billion in debt as of end-September. Reliance also already owns a nationwide licence for high-speed 4G mobile phone networks, which it won by outbidding rivals three years ago. The service, by its Reliance Jio Infocomm unit, has yet to be launched. \"The immediate impact is that of intense competition in auctions,\" Credit Suisse analysts said in a note. \"The longer term impact could be increased competition and higher capex for incumbents,\" the brokerage said, downgrading shares in Bharti Airtel and third-ranked Idea Cellular . Shares in Bharti Airtel and Idea tumbled on Thursday, largely due to Reliance's application to bid. Bharti stock closed 4.8 percent lower, its biggest drop since September last year, while Idea Cellular tumbled 7.2 percent, losing the most since May 2010. Reliance on Wednesday joined seven carriers including Bharti, Vodafone and Idea to bid for spectrum in the auction. India hopes to raise at least $1.8 billion during the fiscal year to March from the auction which is scheduled to start on February 3. Reliance gets most of its revenue from oil and gas. The spectrum bands it applied to bid for would enable the company to provide basic cellphone services, which account for more than 80 percent of industry revenue in India, a country where call rates are among the cheapest in the world. Most telecom operators saw razor-thin margins improve slightly last year after they were able to raise call prices, helped by a court order that revoked permits of some smaller carriers, which were forced to scale back or shut down. Two bands of frequencies -- 900 megahertz and 1800 megahertz - will be sold. Bharti and Vodafone want spectrum in the 900 MHz band to renew permits in key cities like Delhi and Mumbai but they could also use the spectrum for 3G services. Reliance Industries could use the 1,800 MHz band to offer cellphone services or a different kind of 4G network. With the 900 MHz spectrum, it could provide 2G as well as 3G mobile services. Reliance aims to buy spectrum in both bands as 900 MHz is not available beyond Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata, said a person familiar with the company's plans who declined to be named as he is not authorised to talk to the media. Reliance already has deals to share infrastructure with both Bharti and Reliance Communications , which is controlled by Mukesh Ambani's brother, Anil Ambani .",

        "text": "Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio on Monday named Goldman Sachs alum Alicia Glen as deputy mayor for housing and economic development. He also named Laura Santucci, who heads up his transition team, as his City Hall chief of staff. Santucci is a former director of the Democratic National Committee and lobbyist for the hospital-workers union, Local 1199 East, an early backer of the mayor-elect. Glen had headed the Urban Investments Group at Goldman Sachs, which since 2001 invested $2.8billion to development projects in low-income neighborhoods. She worked as assistant commissioner for housing finance at the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development from 1998 to 2002. Glen also helped put together financing for the city's bike-share program. She's is an adjunct professor at Columbia's Business School, where she teaches a graduate-level course called Social Impact of Real Estate Investing and Development. \"Alicia is widely regarded as an outstanding \u0091community banker' with particular expertise in affordable housing and social investment,\" said Kathryn Wylde, CEO of the New York City Partnership. \"Her appointment is a clear signal that the de Blasio administration will be aggressive in pushing expanded housing and neighborhood development.\" Real Estate Board President Steven Spinola said de Blasio's choice of Glen \"continues a string of exceptionally talented and knowledgeable individuals\" who will help the new mayor \"steer our city moving forward.\" \"We look forward to working with Ms. Glen and other city officials towards creating more affordable housing and an environment that will result in more good jobs,\" Spinola said. The kind words show Gotham's business leaders are trying to work with de Blasio. They have chafed at his proposals to tax the rich to fund his pre-kindergarten proposal, and to force developers to provide more low-income housing through \"inclusionary\" zoning. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker also tweeted praises for the work Glen did for Newark when he was mayor there.",

        "text": "MORE ON: Tiler Peck wants you to know there's more to being a ballerina than standing on your toes. Which is why you'll find her \u0097 discussing dance, romance and more \u0097 in AOL's Web series, \"City.Ballet,\" a behind-the-scenes look at the lives of the dancers in Peck's company, New York City Ballet. \"I think ballet should be a little mysterious, but we need to expose ourselves to draw people in,\" says Peck, a top-ranked principal with the company at age 24. \"It isn't boring, like how I thought when I was young. I want people to see how much work and how much discipline it takes.\" The show is the brainchild of \"Sex and the City\" star Sarah Jessica Parker and her production company, Pretty Matches. Unlike the CW's \"Breaking Pointe\" or \"Bunheads\" \u0097 the highly regarded but little-viewed series on ABC Family \u0097 there's no plot. Instead, 12 short episodes will all be released Monday, each dealing with a different topic, like partnering, and one you rarely hear dancers talk about publicly \u0097 injuries. The dancers let you know about their life on the stage and off. Soloist Gina Pazcoguin talks about getting her real-estate license in preparation for life beyond fifth position. You visit at home with principal Ashley Bouder and corps member Silas Farley. As far as Peck's ballet career goes, it's dramatic enough to have come from a movie script. She started dancing barely out of diapers, at her mom's school in Bakersfield, Calif. By age 8 she was tying on pointe shoes and the next year performed in the touring production of the Radio City Christmas Spectacular. At 11, she auditioned for \"The Music Man\" revival on Broadway \u0097 almost as a lark \u0097 and got the part. She moved to New York with her grandmother and continued her dance training at NYCB's school. She wasn't sure she wanted to be a ballerina until she saw \"The Nutcracker\": She turned to her father and said. \"Daddy, I am going to do that some day!\" By 15, she was in the company. Within a few months she got a shot at a major role, Dewdrop, in the very same ballet. Clive Barnes, The Post's late great dance critic, called her \"a bouncy knockout as the Dewdrop,\" and prophesized: \"This girl could one day be terrific. She has personality to spare and a technique that looks totally secure.\" Dewdrop was the first in a series of roles that established her as a breakout virtuoso, and her Broadway experience shines through when she's a sweet but streetwise dame in Jerome Robbins' \"Fancy Free.\" As she's matured, she's changed from a whiz-kid to a ballerina. Along the way, she's found love right in her own barre-yard: In June, she'll marry fellow principal dancer Robert Fairchild, 26. For them, the series may well have been \"The Newlywed Game,\" since they're featured in the episode about relationships. \"They had Robbie and I sit down and asked \u0091What do you think of dancing with one another?' \" she recalls. \"It was the first time we heard what the other was thinking. Luckily, 90 percent of our arguments are over a step in a ballet. We do really well for people who see one another 24/7.\" If you think she's a knockout on camera, wait until you see her live. She's dancing both Dewdrop and the Sugar Plum Fairy in NYCB's \"The Nutcracker\" starting Nov. 29.",
