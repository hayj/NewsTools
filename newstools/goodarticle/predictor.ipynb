      "What a nice weekend! I didnât do anything special but it was nice nonetheless. Today Andrew and I went and saw Spiderman 2 which was really good. I think it was better than the first one despite Kirstenâs attempt at acting again (I am so not a Kristen Dunst fan). Anyway, I highly recommend seeing it in the theaters before it leaves because of some great action sequences. Afterwards, we trotted over to Copley and did a little shopping. Andrew got a really great tie for super cheap; I got some naughties at Victoriaâs Secret and then my cool new laptop bag at Sony that I mentioned the other day. I justified the cost of it because I did a really cool thing. You see I bought my laptop in Mass last weekend and we got our TV in NH. I decided that I was driving to NH to return and buy back my laptop in order to save $100 in taxes. When I called to make sure that I could do that, the girl just went ahead and did it over the phone! I got back $100! Score! So I decided to buy that bag I wanted. Here it is: I went with green because #1 Iâm really into green right now and #2 it was the only cute one that my laptop would fit into to. So I am really happy with it and itâs really hip and light with my computer in it. After our little shopping spree, we headed over to PF Changâs for dinner for some Changâs Spicy Chicken and Moo Shoo Chicken. It was very yummy. :o) Good evening!\n",
